## Vision

At Transflower, we want to see every student’s dream becoming true. The students in higher education’s come with a dream, everyone wants to make a bright career and accordingly work hard to shape their career. The purpose of this portal, is not only to build a career of the students who took the admission and study; also to fulfill the aspirations of many others who are behind them. Their parents, relatives, friends, and off course expectations and future of their family after they are get married.

This is for sure that every one of them wants to study and like to shape their career. We at Transflower strongly believes that no one of them like to spoil their careers if they gets the required guidance and support. Unfortunately, due to various reasons their career ends up with a job which even does not suit their degrees and expectations, making them disappointed.

This is not only their dreams that are broken, but off course we lost an expected skilled manpower that could have contributed to the society, to the economy.

We have an old Indian mythology and concepts, where teachers used to adopt the students for their all round developments. The concept of adoption is necessary for the mentorship. We  adopt students for a given skills sets and sharpens their skills with its well designed program structure.
