## Why Does DevOps Matter?
Asking why DevOps matters is like asking why more is always more. That’s just how the equation plays out. But if all my efforts listing the benefits of DevOps haven’t convinced you, I’ll just have to try again.
There’s no doubt that the world has changed. Software and the internet have modified our lives in just about every way you can imagine. Software is no longer a supplementary component, instead, it’s an integral part of every business.
Companies use software to reach their customers through apps and services and to streamline the way they do business — be it logistics, operations, or communications. As far as software is concerned, the implementation eventualities are limitless.
In a time where everything is becoming computerized, software is the key to all innovations. And, DevOps is what differentiates between good software and great software!
