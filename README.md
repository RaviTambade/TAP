## Vision

At Transflower, we want to see every student’s dream becoming true. The students in higher education’s come with a dream.  Everyone wants to make a bright career. Accordingly  they work hard to shape their career. The purpose of this portal is not only to build a career of students, who took the admission and study. As well as fulfill the aspirations of many others who are behind them; their parents, relatives, friends.

This is for sure that every one of them wants to study and like to shape their career. We at Transflower strongly believes that no one of them like to spoil their careers, if they gets the required guidance and support. Unfortunately, due to various reasons their career ends up with a job which even does not suit their degrees and expectations.  Ity make them disappointed. This is not only their dreams that are broken, but off course we lost an expected skilled manpower that could have contributed to the society as well as to the economy.

We have an old Indian mythology and concepts, where teachers used to adopt the students for their all round developments. The concept of adoption is necessary for the Mentorship. We  adopt students for a given skills sets and sharpens their skills with its well designed program structure.
