### Will Transflower guarantee I'll get a job?
While tech is still growing–even since the economic changes of 2020–we know that there are a lot of concerns around getting hired after a bootcamp. While we don’t offer a job guarantee, we do promise to provide the best in the business career services and coaching. Our career services team helps you during bootcamp, and after bootcamp once you’ve become an alumnus. Combined with our network of employer connections in the Midwest and beyond, and a focus on equipping you to land your dream job through, you’ll have a full set of job-landing tools at your disposal.

### I'm, completely new to coding. Where should I start?
We recommend you start with our Free Intro to Coding Workshops. These three-hour workshops cover the basics of JavaScript and are a great first step for learning how to code. The course is created for people with little-to-no coding experience. You can also attend one of our monthly Info Sessions. Our Info Sessions give you a chance to meet Transflower staff and alumni, review curriculum. It is estimated that 1 million computer-programming jobs will be left unfilled by 2020. Coding bootcamps like ours help fill that gap much more quickly than colleges can. Our team will help you through the process of learning code and coach and support you as you prepare for a career you’ll love.

### Which bootcamp should I take?
Great question. We know this one can slow people down. Here are a few things you can do to help you decide. 

 1. Review the “this bootcamp is the right fit for you if…” section of our JavaScript and C# .NET bootcamps.
              1. A nested numbered list
              2. Which is numbered
 2. Keep in mind it’s a matter of preference, there is no right or wrong. Search for jobs in web development that include “front end” “web development” “JavaScript” or “back end” or “C# .NET” out of the jobs you find, note which ones appeal to you the most. Some people look for employers they want to work for and note what jobs they hire for the most.
 3. Attend one of our many events! Info sessions, coding workshops, and our other monthly events are great places for you to get to know the lay of the land.
 4. Take a workshop! They’re taught by bootcamp graduates who once asked the same question. They make coding un-intimidating and can answer your career questions along the way.

### Who's your average student?
Our classrooms are filled with smart, tenacious people who are excited (and a bit nervous) to embark on a new journey into tech careers. Students come from a variety of professional backgrounds — from yoga instructors, healthcare professionals, to retail sales professionals and just about everything in between. We believe tech should reflect the diversity of the real world. We celebrate all backgrounds, races, ethnicities, orientations, and gender identities. Our affinity groups are a great way to connect with other people who share your walk of life. We strive to create a collaborative, diverse classroom and if you’ve made it this far into the FAQ, you’ll fit right in. You can get more details on demographics in our Outcomes report.

### What are you looking for in a candidate?
Our most successful students come to us with some, but not a ton, of programming experience. Many of our students have dabbled in code through online tutorials and courses through Codecademy or Udacity. We’re looking for students who are smart, tenacious, resourceful and hardworking. It should go without saying, but an interest in coding everyday is a must. You’ve gotta like it!

We want candidates that are self-motivated and committed to the Transflower Acceleration Program (TAP). There will be assignments that have to be completed at night and over weekends, so candidates should be prepared to put in the necessary work to be successful. They also need to be punctual for every class and resourceful in how they complete coursework. Learning any new skill can become frustrating, so it’s important to see this opportunity as a welcome challenge, rather than a stress-inducing problem.

### Is there a minimum(or maximum) are for bootcamp students?
To qualify for our bootcamps, an individual must be 18 years or older and have their Bacholors in Engineering or MCA, MCS.

### Do I need to have a bachelor's degree?
A bachelor’s degree is not required to get into our coding bootcamps. We’ve had many students without degrees become very successful and find great jobs that they love. One of the coolest parts about coding bootcamps is it is a way to enter this field without a degree. However, it’s important to note that some jobs in the tech industry will require a four-year degree.

### Do I need to be good at math?
It’s a myth that you need to be a mathematician to be a coder. Logic and problem-solving skills are vital to being a developer though, and those skills are closely related to math. But don’t worry, we won’t ask you to do trigonometry or algebra.

### How do I apply?
It’s easy—start by filling out our application form. Once we receive your application, the Transflower team reviews your responses and selects a limited number of candidates for a video interview. Then, you’ll be notified of your admission decision.


### Who are your instructors?
Our instructors come from a variety of backgrounds, including Microsoft Certified Trainers, seasoned developers, bootcamp alumni, industry professionals and other tech enthusiasts. All instructors and course work are reviewed and approved by our  Chief Mentor, Director of Learning.


### What computer equipment do I need for bootcamp?

Great question! In short, you’ll need good laptop. A second monitor/TV/tablet will really help you out. You’ll need a Windows, Mac, or Linux computer. ChromeOS does not support all the software you will need. If you want to use a Linux computer, know that there will be slight differences between your software and what you see on teacher screens. Windows is the best platform for a .NET Bootcamp. You can use a Mac in a .NET Bootcamp, but you will need to install Windows on it using Apple Boot Camp

### Specific laptop specs

CPU: 
Minimum: At least a dual-core 2Ghz or higher (Intel i3/i5/i7 or AMD equivalent)
Recommended: At least quad-core (4 cores) Intel i5 or i7, AMD Ryzen 5/7/9, or (Mac) M1
RAM: 8 GB or more is ideal
Storage: Please make sure you have at least 15GB free space for software and projects. A Solid State Drive (SSD) recommended for better performance.
Display: A 12-inch screen with 1366×768 resolution will serve you well
Second Monitor: For remote bootcamps, a second screen is recommended–if you don’t have a monitor for a second screen, you could use a television or potentially a tablet.

### Do I need to do anything before bootcamp?
Before the first day, every bootcamp student completes two full weeks of mandatory pre-work we call Unit 1. This work provides the foundation for the bootcamp lessons and covers fundamentals that all successful developers need to know. But you’re not on your own: we offer Tech Wednesdays each week which are specifically designed to help you troubleshoot all your Unit 1 questions. We also strongly recommend you reach out to developers either in the Transflower community or others you may know to learn more about their experiences in tech.
