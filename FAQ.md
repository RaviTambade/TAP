<summary>Which bootcamp should I take?</summary>
Great question. We know this one can slow people down. Here are a few things you can do to help you decide. 
 1. Keep in mind it’s a matter of preference, there is no right or wrong. Search for jobs in web development that include "front end", "web development" "JavaScript" or "back end" or "C# .NET" or "Java" or "Python" out of the jobs you find, note which ones appeal to you the most. Some people look for employers they want to work for and note what jobs they hire for the most.
 2. Attend one of our many events! Info sessions, coding workshops, and our other monthly events are great places for you to get to know the lay of the land.
 3. Take a workshop! They’re taught by bootcamp graduates who once asked the same question. They make coding un-intimidating and can answer your career questions along the way.

<summary>What are you looking for in a candidate?</summary>
Our most successful students come to us with some, but not a ton, of programming experience. Many of our students have dabbled in code through online tutorials and courses through Youtube, Codecademy or Udacity. We’re looking for students who are smart, tenacious, resourceful and hardworking. It should go without saying, but an interest in coding everyday is a must. You’ve gotta like it!
We want candidates that are self-motivated and committed to the Transflower Acceleration Program (TAP). There will be assignments that have to be completed at night and over weekends, so candidates should be prepared to put in the necessary work to be successful. They also need to be punctual for every class and resourceful in how they complete coursework. Learning any new skill can become frustrating, so it’s important to see this opportunity as a welcome challenge, rather than a stress-inducing problem.

It’s a myth that you need to be a mathematician to be a coder. Logic and problem-solving skills are vital to being a developer though, and those skills are closely related to math. But don’t worry, we won’t ask you to do trigonometry or algebra.

<summary>What computer equipment do I need for bootcamp?</summary>
Great question! In short, you’ll need good laptop. A second monitor/TV/tablet will really help you out. You’ll need a Windows, Mac, or Linux computer. ChromeOS does not support all the software you will need. If you want to use a Linux computer, know that there will be slight differences between your software and what you see on teacher screens. Windows is the best platform for a .NET Bootcamp. You can use a Mac in a .NET Bootcamp, but you will need to install Windows on it using Apple Boot Camp
