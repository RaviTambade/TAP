# 🧠⚙️ C++ Fullstack TAP Program

**(C++ • Backend Systems • REST/gRPC • Frontend • Databases)**
**12–16 Weeks | Skill → Proof → Employability**
*Transflower Apprenticeship Program*

> *“If software engineering were physics, C++ would be mechanics.”*
> It teaches you **how systems really work**—memory, performance, and control.

## 🧭 TAP Design Principles (Transflower DNA)

* Fundamentals before frameworks
* Control over convenience
* Performance with responsibility
* Employer trust through **engineering depth**

## 🔰 Phase 1: Thinking in C++

### **Weeks 1–3 | Systems Thinking Foundation**

### 🎯 Objective

Move students from *syntax users* to **low-level system thinkers**.

### Skills Covered

* C++ syntax & compilation model
* Memory management (stack vs heap)
* Pointers & references
* RAII principles
* STL containers & algorithms
* Exception handling

### Hands-on Work

* Memory tracing exercises
* Data structure implementations
* Refactoring unsafe code

### TAP Evidence

* Memory safety score
* Code correctness review
* Mentor system reasoning feedback

🧠 **Mentor checkpoint:**

> “Who owns this memory—and when is it released?”

## 🧱 Phase 2: Backend Engineering with C++

### **Weeks 4–6 | High-Performance Server Thinking**

### 🎯 Objective

Understand **how backend systems work at the system level**.

### Skills Covered

* C++ backend architecture
* HTTP fundamentals
* REST API design in C++
* Libraries (Crow / Pistache / Boost.Beast)
* Multithreading basics

### Hands-on Work

* C++ REST server
* Request–response lifecycle handling
* Thread-safe services

### TAP Evidence

* Backend performance score
* Concurrency awareness index

🧠 **Mentor checkpoint:**

> “What happens if two requests hit this function at the same time?”

## 🗄️ Phase 3: Databases & Persistence

### **Weeks 7–9 | Data Integrity with Performance**

### 🎯 Objective

Teach students to **connect systems with reliable data layers**.

### Skills Covered

* SQL fundamentals
* Database design & normalization
* C++ database connectivity (ODBC / libpq / MySQL Connector)
* Prepared statements
* Transaction safety

### Hands-on Work

* CRUD operations from C++
* Connection pooling
* Error & failure handling

### TAP Evidence

* Data access reliability score
* Transaction safety maturity

🧠 **Mentor checkpoint:**

> “What happens if the DB connection drops mid-transaction?”

## 🎨 Phase 4: Frontend Integration

### **Weeks 10–11 | Bridging Systems to Users**

### 🎯 Objective

Help students understand **how low-level systems serve real users**.

### Skills Covered

* HTML & CSS fundamentals
* JavaScript basics
* Frontend consuming C++ APIs
* JSON serialization/deserialization

### Hands-on Work

* Web UI interacting with C++ backend
* Data visualization dashboards
* End-to-end flow testing

### TAP Evidence

* System-to-UI integration demo
* Data flow explanation

🧠 **Mentor checkpoint:**

> “Why does the frontend need this data—and in this format?”

## 🔐 Phase 5: Security, Performance & Engineering Discipline

### **Weeks 12–13 | Professional Systems Phase**

### 🎯 Objective

Shift mindset from *coder* to **systems engineer**.

### Skills Covered

* Secure coding practices
* Input validation
* Memory safety & vulnerabilities
* Performance profiling
* Git workflows

### Hands-on Work

* Hardened API endpoints
* Profiling & optimization
* Code reviews with performance focus

### TAP Evidence

* Security & performance index
* Engineering discipline score

🧠 **Mentor checkpoint:**

> “If this runs under load, where does it break first?”


## 🚀 Phase 6: Capstone Project & Deployment

### **Weeks 14–16 | Engineering Proof**

### 🎯 Objective

Deliver **high-performance, employer-verifiable systems**.

### Capstone Project Examples

* High-performance REST service
* Trading or analytics backend
* IoT device management platform
* Game backend / simulation server

### Mandatory Deliverables

* C++ backend service
* Database integration
* Thread-safe architecture
* Frontend client
* Deployment on Linux server
* Architecture & performance report

### TAP Evidence

* Live deployed service
* GitHub repository
* Performance benchmarks
* Mentor evaluation
* Employer-ready profile

🧠 **Final mentor review:**

> “Why is C++ justified for this system?”


## 📊 Employer-Ready Outcomes

By the end of C++ Fullstack TAP, learners have:

✅ Deep systems & memory understanding

## 🌱 Transflower Closing Reflection

C++ Fullstack is not for:

* Fast certificates
* UI-only developers
* Shortcut seekers

It is for:

* **System builders**
* **Performance engineers**
* **People who want control**

At Transflower, C++ is not taught as a language.
It is taught as a **thinking discipline**.


### 🔜 Where this fits best

C++ Fullstack TAP prepares learners for:

* System software companies
* High-performance backend teams
* Game development studios
* IoT & embedded platforms
* Quant & analytics firms
