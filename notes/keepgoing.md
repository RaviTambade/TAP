“A teacher is one who makes himself progressively unnecessary.”
— Thomas Carruthers

You can't keep up with new technologies. Yes I do understand. You are not alone. Hidden potential need to be tapped. The process I've been following for years has helped me tremendously advance my career and stay relevant. After all learning and teaching is my passion. Sharing is caring. Love to share things I do follow:

𝟭. 𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗲 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘆 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝗼𝘂𝘀
Don't feel intimidated by new technologies. Try to view them as opportunities to expand your skill set and stay relevant in the industry.

𝟮. 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘆 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗽
Follow industry leaders on social media and watch at least the keynotes of the biggest tech conferences, and subscribe to tech channels.

𝟯. 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵
Besides mastering ASP.NET Core, you should learn at least one database, one message broker, a few Azure services, and more.

𝟰. 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴
Build something with your own hands, from scratch, using the latest tech. That's the absolute best way to solidify your learning.

𝟱. 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗹𝘆 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸
Find ways to apply your new knowledge to your current projects. Doing things differently will take more time at first, but it will pay off.
