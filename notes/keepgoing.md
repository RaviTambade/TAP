## *“A teacher is one who makes himself progressively unnecessary.”* — Thomas Carruthers

Let me tell you something I’ve learned the hard way — **you can’t keep up with everything**.
And that’s okay.
You’re not alone. Most of us have felt that way.

Even I have sat with that uneasy feeling — new frameworks launching, acronyms flying everywhere, AI tools rewriting the rules every few months.
But here's a thought I hold on to:

> **There is always hidden potential inside each of us. We just need to tap into it.**

For years, I’ve followed a simple yet powerful process that has helped me stay relevant and grow — not just as a developer, but as a mentor and teacher. And because I believe *sharing is caring*, I want to share it with you.


### 1️⃣ **Embrace Change & Stay Curious**

> “Sir, it’s too much. New tech keeps coming. I feel left behind.”
> That’s what one of my students said to me.

I smiled and replied — “Don’t fear change, **ride it like a wave**.”

Instead of resisting new technologies, see them as new **toys in your playground**. They’re not here to threaten you, they’re here to **extend your superpowers**.

So ask yourself often:

> *What am I curious about today?*
> That question alone can unlock a whole new path.


### 2️⃣ **Stay in the Loop — Even Passively**

You don’t need to read 10 blogs a day or attend every webinar. Just **stay connected** to the ecosystem.

> 🧠 Follow thought leaders on X (Twitter), LinkedIn, GitHub
> 🎥 Watch keynote sessions from events like Microsoft Build, Google I/O, or GitHub Universe
> 📺 Subscribe to 2-3 good tech YouTube channels (you don’t need more)

It’s like sunlight — you don’t need to study it, but staying under it regularly gives you energy.


### 3️⃣ **Start Learning the Latest Tech — One Brick at a Time**

Don't wait for a perfect syllabus. Begin with what’s around you.

You're already learning **ASP.NET Core** — great start. Now add these to your toolkit:

* A database (SQL Server / MySQL / MongoDB)
* A message broker (RabbitMQ / Azure Service Bus)
* A few **Azure services** (Functions, Storage, App Services)
* GitHub Actions or Jenkins for CI/CD

Think of it like a recipe. You’re learning each ingredient before cooking your own dish.


### 4️⃣ **Build Something — Anything**

One thing I tell every mentee:

> “Don't just be a reader. Be a builder.”

Create something small — a ToDo app, a student dashboard, a blog engine. Use the latest tech stack.
When you build with your own hands, you fight real bugs, see real results, and build real confidence.

That’s how you move from learner to doer.


### 5️⃣ **Apply What You Learn — Even at Work**

You don’t need permission to grow. Find a corner of your project where you can experiment:

* Use LINQ instead of for-loops
* Add a caching layer using Redis
* Refactor one module with SOLID principles

It might take time. You may break things. But trust me — this **slow burn** pays off.


### 💡 Final Thought: Tap Your Potential

You don’t have to do *extraordinary* things.

Just do ordinary things with **extraordinary focus, love, and intention**.

That’s what we try to instill through **Transflower Mentor as a Service** — not just tools and code, but **clarity**, **courage**, and a **community**.

Let’s keep learning, teaching, and evolving — until one day, our students no longer need us. And that, my friend, will be our proudest moment.
