## 🌱 Transflower Learner’s Pledge

### *Read it. Live it. Become it.*

I pledge to **think before I code**,
and to seek understanding, not shortcuts.

I pledge to **ask why**,
even when answers are uncomfortable.

I pledge to **treat problems as teachers**,
and failure as feedback.

I pledge to **build before I claim**,
and prove my learning through action.

I pledge to **respect systems**,
knowing that every solution impacts people, business, and trust.

I pledge to **learn with others**,
to share freely, review honestly, and grow together.

I pledge to **accept mentorship with humility**,
and to one day, mentor others with responsibility.

I pledge to **own my learning**,
without blaming syllabus, teachers, tools, or circumstances.

I pledge to **stay curious**,
even after success, recognition, or mastery.

### ✍️ Commitment

By taking this pledge, I choose the path of **discipline over shortcuts**,
**depth over noise**, and **growth over comfort**.

I commit to becoming not just a professional,
but a **thinking, responsible, and humane builder**.
