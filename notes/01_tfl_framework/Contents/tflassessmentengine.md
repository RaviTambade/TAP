# 🌼 TFLAssessment

## **AI-Assisted Assessment Engine – Official Design**

> **“Assessment is not judgment. It is guidance with evidence.”**


## 1. Purpose of TFLAssessment Engine

The TFLAssessment Engine exists to:

* Measure **capability**, not memory
* Reveal **skill gaps**, not just scores
* Assist **mentors**, not replace them
* Adapt assessments to **learner context**
* Align tightly with **TFL curriculum layers**


## 2. Core Design Philosophy

### ❌ What This Engine Is NOT

* Not an exam paper generator
* Not a fully automated grading machine
* Not AI-led decision maker

### ✅ What This Engine IS

* Mentor-controlled
* Skill-mapped
* Outcome-driven
* AI-assisted
* Human-in-the-loop

📌 **Golden Rule**

> *AI suggests. Mentors decide.*

## 3. Assessment Coverage Across TFL Layers

| TFL Layer | Assessment Focus | AI Role                                  |
| --------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Layer 1   | Concept clarity  | Generate explanation & analogy questions |
| Layer 2   | Logic & coding   | Generate code, debug & output Qs         |
| Layer 3   | System flow      | Generate diagrams & flow questions       |
| Layer 4   | Application      | Evaluate projects & code quality         |
| Layer 5   | Architecture     | Assess design reasoning & trade-offs     |
| Layer 6   | Role readiness   | Role-based assessment & interview prep   |

## 5. Core Components (Detailed)


### 🔹 1. Skill Taxonomy Engine (Foundation)

Every assessment is anchored to **skills**, not topics.

```
Layer → Skill → Sub-skill → Concept → Outcome
```

**Example**

```
Layer 3
Skill: Web Architecture
Sub-skill: Statelessness
Concept: HTTP is stateless
Outcome: Can explain scalability benefits
```

📌 This ensures **precision in assessment**.


### 🔹 2. Question Blueprint Engine (Your Secret Weapon)

Before AI generates anything, mentors define **blueprints**.

**Blueprint defines:**

* Question type (MCQ / Coding / Scenario)
* Bloom’s level
* Difficulty
* Expected outcome
* Evaluation criteria

**Example Blueprint**

```
Type: Scenario
Bloom: Analyze
Difficulty: Medium
Skill: Dependency Injection
Outcome: Can choose correct service lifetime
```

AI only fills the **content**, not the intent.


### 🔹 3. AI Generation Layer (LLM)

AI is used for:

* Question generation
* Multiple variations
* Contextualization
* Real-world framing

**Controlled Prompt Structure**

```
Context: TFL Layer 4
Skill: ASP.NET Core DI
Bloom Level: Apply
Difficulty: Medium
Question Type: Scenario
Constraints: No trick questions
```

📌 This avoids hallucinations and randomness.


### 🔹 4. Validation & Guardrails (Critical)

No question reaches learners without validation.

**Validation Includes**

* Correctness check
* Duplicate detection
* Difficulty alignment
* Answer verification
* Code execution (for coding Qs)

❗ Mentor approval optional but recommended initially.


### 🔹 5. Evaluation Engine

Evaluation varies by question type.

| Type     | Evaluation Method     |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| MCQ      | Auto-evaluated        |
| Coding   | Output + logic check  |
| Scenario | Rubric-based          |
| Design   | Mentor + AI reasoning |
| Project  | Evidence-based review |

AI assists with:

* Partial credit
* Pattern recognition
* Feedback generation


### 🔹 6. Analytics & Skill Gap Engine

This is where **assessment becomes mentorship**.

**Outputs**

* Skill mastery %
* Weak concept clusters
* Bloom-level gaps
* Time vs accuracy insights

**Mentor View**

> “Student understands MVC but struggles with DI lifetimes.”


## 6. Assessment Types Supported

| Type           | Purpose                |
| -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Diagnostic     | Entry assessment       |
| Formative      | During learning        |
| Summative      | Layer completion       |
| Skill-gap      | Targeted reinforcement |
| Role-readiness | Job alignment          |


## 7. Mentor Dashboard (Key Features)

* Select TFL layer
* Select skills
* Choose difficulty mix
* Review AI-generated questions
* Approve / edit questions
* View learner analytics
* Recommend next learning steps

Mentors stay **in control** at all times.


## 8. Learner Experience Flow

```
Login
 → Select Assessment
   → Attempt Questions
     → Submit
       → Receive Feedback
         → See Skill Map
           → Mentor Guidance
```

Feedback focuses on **learning**, not fear.

## 9. Technology-Agnostic Design (Practical)

You can implement this using:

* .NET / Java / Node backend
* Any LLM (OpenAI / Azure / Open-source)
* SQL + Vector DB (later)
* Rule engine + AI hybrid

Architecture supports **incremental intelligence**.



## 10. MVP Roadmap (Highly Recommended)

### Phase 1 – Mentor-Controlled MVP

* Manual blueprints
* AI question generation
* Mentor approval
* Basic analytics

### Phase 2 – Intelligence Layer

* Skill-gap detection
* Adaptive difficulty
* Auto recommendations

### Phase 3 – Adaptive Assessment
