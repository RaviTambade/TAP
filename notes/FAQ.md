## 👩‍🏫 What is TAP?

Let me tell you a story.

Years ago, I watched fresh graduates walk into their first IT job interviews — nervous, uncertain, but full of dreams. The biggest hurdle? **The gap between what they had learned and what the industry expected.**

That’s where **TAP — Transflower Acceleration Program** was born.

> TAP isn’t just another bootcamp. It’s a bridge — between your raw potential and the professional you’re meant to become.

We follow a **project-based learning model** in an **online collaborative environment**. TAP empowers freshers to become **industry-ready FullStack Developers** with guidance from mentors who’ve walked the path for over 25 years.

TAP believes:

> *“Learning is not a destination. It’s a continuous journey.”*


## 💻 Are TAP bootcamps in-person or online?

All TAP sessions are **100% online**, conducted live through Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Google Meet. No pre-recorded monologues. Just real-time interaction, doubt-solving, and hands-on practice — guided by mentors who’ve spent years mastering both teaching and tech.
