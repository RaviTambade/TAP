---

## 🚀 Phase 6: Capstone + Deployment

### **Weeks 14–16 | Proof & Employer Readiness**

*(Weeks 14–15 for fast learners, 16 for deep polish)*

### 🎯 Objective

Create **employer-inspectable evidence**.

### Capstone Project

Examples:

* Appointment Booking System
* Learning Management Platform
* Inventory / Order Management
* SaaS-style CRUD platform

### Mandatory Deliverables

* Live cloud deployment
* REST APIs
* Authentication
* Database design
* README & architecture doc

### TAP Evidence

* Live project URL
* GitHub activity timeline
* Mentor evaluation
* Employer-ready profile

🧠 **Final mentor review:**

> “If you join a team tomorrow—what will you own?”
