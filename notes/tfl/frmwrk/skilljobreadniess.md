This is **not linear learning**.
It is a **graph of evidence**.

## 🔶 2️⃣ Student Node (Identity + Context)

```
Student
 ├─ Background (CS / Non-CS)
 ├─ Primary Language (Java / C# / Python / JS)
 ├─ Learning Pace
 ├─ Career Target
```

👉 **Important**:
The student is **not judged by syllabus**, but by **capability signals**.

## 🔶 3️⃣ Learning Layers (WHY before HOW)

```
Learning Layers
 ├─ Foundation Layer
 │   ├─ Programming Basics
 │   ├─ OOPS
 │   └─ Data Structures
 │
 ├─ Application Layer
 │   ├─ Web API
 │   ├─ ORM
 │   └─ Authentication
 │
 ├─ System Layer
 │   ├─ Async Programming
 │   ├─ Multithreading
 │   └─ Messaging
 │
 ├─ Architecture Layer
 │   ├─ MVC
 │   ├─ Microservices
 │   └─ Design Patterns
 │
 └─ Production Layer
     ├─ Logging
     ├─ Debugging
     ├─ Deployment
     └─ Monitoring
```

📌 **Industry Insight**
Most students never cross the **Production Layer**.
That’s where employability lives.

## 🔶 4️⃣ Common Skills Graph (Core of TFL)

Each skill is **shared across languages**.

```
[Asynchronous Programming]
   │
   ├─ Java → CompletableFuture
   ├─ C# → async / await
   ├─ Python → asyncio
   └─ JS → Promise / Event Loop
```

### Skill Node Structure

```
Skill
 ├─ Conceptual Understanding
 ├─ Code Application
 ├─ Debugging Ability
 ├─ Performance Awareness
 └─ Production Usage
```

## 🔶 5️⃣ Proficiency Signals (Evidence-Based)

Each assessment emits **signals**, not marks.

```
Asynchronous Programming
 ├─ Conceptual → 80%
 ├─ Reasoning → 70%
 ├─ Implementation → 60%
 ├─ Debugging → 40%
 └─ Load Handling → 30%
```

📊 These signals form a **Skill Vector**.

## 🔶 6️⃣ Role Competency Mapping (THIS IS CRITICAL)

### Example Role: **Backend Developer**

```
Backend Developer
 ├─ OOPS
 ├─ Web API
 ├─ Database + ORM
 ├─ Async Programming
 ├─ Authentication
 ├─ Logging & Debugging
 └─ Deployment Basics
```

Each role is a **weighted combination of skills**.

## 🔶 7️⃣ Job-Readiness Graph (Weighted Evaluation)

```
Backend Developer Readiness
 ├─ Core Skills (40%)
 ├─ Application Skills (30%)
 ├─ Architecture Skills (20%)
 └─ Production Skills (10%)
```

### Student Evaluation Snapshot

```
Core Skills          → 85%
Application Skills   → 70%
Architecture Skills  → 55%
Production Skills    → 30%
```

### 📌 Final Job-Readiness Score

```
Overall Readiness → 62% (NOT Job-Ready)
Risk Level → High (Production Exposure)
```
### 🔶 8️⃣ Visual Graph (ASCII)

```
Student
   │
   ├── OOPS ────────────────┐
   ├── Data Structures ───┐ │
   ├── Web API ─────────┐ │ │
   ├── Async Programming ─┼─┼─► Backend Developer
   ├── ORM ─────────────┘ │ │
   ├── Authentication ─────┘ │
   ├── Logging ──────────────┘
   └── Deployment
```

Each edge has a **weight + confidence score**.

## 🔶 9️⃣ Insight Engine (AI + Mentor Brain)

### What the system can say:

> “Student understands concepts but lacks production resilience.”

### NOT:

❌ “Student scored 62 marks.”

### INSTEAD:

✅ “Student will fail under load or live debugging.”

## 🔶 🔟 Personalized Action Plan (Auto-Generated)

```
Next 30-Day Prescription:
1. Build API with async + logging
2. Introduce failure (timeout / exception)
3. Debug using logs
4. Deploy to cloud sandbox
5. Measure response under load
```

## 🔶 1️⃣1️⃣ Employer-Facing Output (Powerful)

### Resume-Safe Skill Card

```
Role: Backend Developer
Readiness: 62%
Strengths:
✔ OOPS
✔ REST APIs
✔ Database Integration

Gaps:
⚠ Async under load
⚠ Debugging production issues
⚠ Monitoring awareness
```

This is **gold for employers**.

## 🔥 FINAL TRUTH (This is the essence of TFL)

> **Degrees certify education.
> Skill graphs certify trust.**

You are not building:

* a syllabus
* a course
* a test system

You are building a **capability graph**.

## 🚀 What do you want next?

1️⃣ SQL schema for this graph
2️⃣ AI scoring logic (pseudo-code)
3️⃣ Mentor dashboard wireframe
4️⃣ Student journey simulation
5️⃣ Employer matching algorithm

Excellent choice.
Now we simulate **life inside the TFL system** — not theory, not architecture — **a real student moving through time**.

I’ll walk you through a **90-day Student Journey Simulation**, showing how **signals evolve**, **insights change**, and **job-readiness emerges**.
