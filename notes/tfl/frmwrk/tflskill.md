# Transflower Learning Framework (TFL)

## Skill → Assessment Blueprint

## 1. Purpose of Skill → Assessment Blueprint

This blueprint defines **how each skill in the TFL Skills Taxonomy is measured, validated, and evolved** using structured assessments.

It ensures:

* Skills are **provable**, not assumed
* Assessments go beyond MCQs
* AI + Mentor co-evaluation
* Continuous skill health monitoring
* Job-readiness confidence

> **Principle:** *Every skill must leave evidence.*

## 2. Assessment Dimensions (Universal)

Each skill is assessed across **5 dimensions**:

| Dimension  | Measures                         |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| Conceptual | Understanding of theory & intent |
| Analytical | Reasoning & decision making      |
| Practical  | Ability to apply in code/design  |
| Diagnostic | Debugging & fault analysis       |
| Reflective | Ability to explain & justify     |

## 3. Assessment Types (TFL Standard)

### A. Knowledge Checks

* MCQs (conceptual, scenario-based)
* True/False with justification
* Match-the-following

### B. Skill Drills

* Short coding exercises
* Pseudocode writing
* Refactoring tasks

### C. Applied Challenges

* Mini features
* Bug-fix challenges
* API design tasks

### D. Design & Reasoning

* System design questions
* Architecture trade-offs
* Whiteboard-style explanations

### E. Project Evidence

* Code repositories
* Design documents
* Demo recordings

## 4. Skill Depth vs Assessment Mapping

| Skill Level             | Assessment Nature      |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Level 1 – Awareness     | Concept questions      |
| Level 2 – Understanding | Explain / classify     |
| Level 3 – Application   | Coding / building      |
| Level 4 – Optimization  | Improve / refactor     |
| Level 5 – Mastery       | Design / mentor others |

## 5. L1 – Foundational Skills → Assessment

### Example: Problem Decomposition

**Assessment Types:**

* Given a real-world problem, break into steps
* Flowchart creation
* Identify inputs, outputs, constraints

**Question Types:**

* Scenario-based reasoning
* Ordering steps logically
* Explain approach verbally

**AI Signals:**

* Logical sequence correctness
* Completeness

## 6. L2 – Programming Skills → Assessment

### Example: Encapsulation

**Concept Questions:**

* Why encapsulation matters?
* Identify encapsulation violations

**Coding Tasks:**

* Design a class with proper access control
* Refactor public fields to private

**Diagnostic Tasks:**

* Find bugs due to poor encapsulation

**Reflective:**

* Explain design choices

### Example: Polymorphism

**Concept:**

* Runtime vs compile-time polymorphism

**Practical:**

* Implement interface-based behavior
* Override methods correctly

**Analytical:**

* Predict output for polymorphic calls


## 7. L3 – Application Skills → Assessment

### Example: REST API Design

**Concept:**

* HTTP verbs, status codes

**Applied:**

* Design CRUD APIs
* Validate inputs

**Diagnostic:**

* Fix incorrect API responses

**Design:**

* Versioning strategy

### Example: Data Access (ORM)

**Tasks:**

* Map entities
* Write queries
* Optimize queries

**Signals:**

* Correctness
* Performance awareness

## 8. L4 – System & Architecture Skills → Assessment

### Example: Microservices Architecture

**Conceptual:**

* Why microservices?

**Design:**

* Split monolith into services
* Define communication patterns

**Analytical:**

* Identify failure points

**Reflective:**

* Trade-off justification

### Example: Messaging Systems

**Applied:**

* Producer–consumer implementation

**Diagnostic:**

* Message loss scenarios

**Optimization:**

* Scaling consumers

## 9. L5 – Professional Skills → Assessment

### Example: Debugging

**Tasks:**

* Fix broken code
* Analyze logs

**Signals:**

* Root cause identification
* Systematic approach


### Example: Collaboration (Git)

**Tasks:**

* Resolve merge conflicts
* Write meaningful commits

**Evaluation:**

* Clarity
* Discipline


## 10. Evidence-Based Scoring Model

Each assessment produces:

| Output           | Meaning         |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| Skill Score      | % mastery       |
| Confidence Score | Stability       |
| Evidence Count   | Proof artifacts |
| Regression Flag  | Skill decay     |


## 11. AI + Mentor Evaluation Model

### AI Responsibilities

* Auto-grade MCQs
* Code correctness checks
* Pattern recognition

### Mentor Responsibilities

* Design judgment
* Explanation quality
* Real-world alignment

## 12. Skill Regression Detection

Regression triggers when:

* Long inactivity
* Repeated errors
* Failed higher-level tasks

Recovery actions:

* Skill gym
* Micro-lessons
* Targeted drills

## 13. Blueprint Philosophy

> **"Assess learning like a doctor checks health — continuously, deeply, and holistically."**
