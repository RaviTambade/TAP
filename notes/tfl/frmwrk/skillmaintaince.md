Excellent.
This is the **final maturity layer of TFL**.

If *curriculum* teaches skills,
**Auto-Maintenance Curriculum keeps skills alive**.

Think of it as a **Skill Gym**, not a classroom.

# 🔁 AUTO-MAINTENANCE CURRICULUM (AMC)

### *Keeping skills fresh, reliable, and job-ready*

---

## 🧠 1️⃣ What is Auto-Maintenance Curriculum?

> A **continuous, low-friction learning loop** that:

* prevents skill decay
* detects early regression
* keeps job-readiness honest
* requires **minutes per week**, not months

📌 **This runs AFTER the main learning journey.**

---

## 🔥 2️⃣ Why Traditional Education Fails Here

Traditional model:

```
Learn → Test → Certificate → Forget
```

Reality:

```
Learn → Use → Pause → Forget → Panic in job
```

TFL adds:

```
Learn → Use → Maintain → Refresh → Trust
```

---

## 🧱 3️⃣ AMC Architecture (High-Level)

  ├─ Stable → Light Maintenance
  ├─ Drifting → Targeted Refresh
  └─ Regressing → Recovery Loop
```

## 🧩 4️⃣ Skill Maintenance Categories

Every skill belongs to **one maintenance group**.

### 🟢 Type A: Low Decay (Monthly)

* HTML / CSS
* Basic Syntax
* Simple CRUD

### 🟠 Type B: Medium Decay (Bi-weekly)

* ORM
* Authentication
* State Management

### 🔴 Type C: High Decay (Weekly)

* Async Programming
* Debugging
* Microservices
* Performance tuning

📌 **This classification is critical.**

---

## 🛠️ 5️⃣ Maintenance Unit (MU) – The Core Building Block

> AMC does NOT use courses.
> It uses **Maintenance Units**.

### A Maintenance Unit is:

* ⏱ 10–20 minutes
* 🎯 One skill
* 💥 One failure scenario
* 🔄 One correction

---

### Example MU: **Async Programming**

```
Trigger:
No async usage for 14 days

Task:
Refactor blocking API → async

Failure Injected:
Missing await

Expected Outcome:
Fix + explain root cause
```

✅ Skill refreshed
📈 Stability score updated

---

## 🧠 6️⃣ Maintenance Types (Very Important)

---

### 🔹 1. Recall Maintenance (Light)

**Goal**: Keep concepts accessible
**Used when**: Skill is stable

Example:

> “Why is async needed in Web APIs?”

⏱ 5 mins

---

### 🔹 2. Application Maintenance (Medium)

**Goal**: Keep hands-on fluency
**Used when**: Slight drift detected

Example:

> “Fix this N+1 query.”

⏱ 15 mins

---

### 🔹 3. Failure Maintenance (Strongest)

**Goal**: Preserve real-world readiness
**Used when**: High-risk skill

Example:

> “System is slow under load. Logs attached.”

⏱ 20 mins

📌 **Failure-based maintenance is non-negotiable.**

---

## 🔄 7️⃣ AMC Scheduling Logic

TFL does **not flood the student**.

### Smart Scheduler Rules:

```
Max Maintenance Tasks / Week = 3
Max Time / Week = 45 minutes
One task per skill
```

---

### Sample Weekly AMC Plan

```
Week Plan:
✔ Async Programming (Failure MU)
✔ ORM Performance (Application MU)
✔ Logging (Recall MU)
```

---

## 📊 8️⃣ Skill Freshness Score (Employer-Grade)

Each skill gets a **Freshness Index**.

```
Async Programming
Mastery: 72%
Freshness: 91%
Last Used: 5 days ago
```

📌 Employers trust **fresh skills**, not old certificates.

---

## 🧑‍🏫 9️⃣ Mentor Dashboard (AMC View)

```
Student: Arun
Stable Skills: 18
Drifting Skills: 4
Regressing Skills: 1

AMC Load: Light
Risk Level: Low
```

Mentor intervenes only when **automation fails**.

---

## 🔁 1️⃣0️⃣ AMC → Job Readiness Integrity

Without AMC:

```
Job Readiness Score = Static (Lies over time)
```

With AMC:

```
Job Readiness Score = Living Signal
```

📉 Readiness can drop
📈 Readiness can recover
✔ Trust maintained

---

## 🔥 1️⃣1️⃣ Core TFL Insight (Read Carefully)

> **Learning is acquisition.
> Maintenance is reliability.**

Companies don’t hire knowledge.
They hire **reliable capability under time pressure**.

AMC creates that reliability.

---

## 🧠 1️⃣2️⃣ Real-World Analogy (Perfect Fit)

| Profession | Maintenance      |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| Doctor     | Case reviews     |
| Pilot      | Simulator drills |
| Athlete    | Training         |
| Engineer   | AMC              |

No professional survives without maintenance.

---

## 🧩 1️⃣3️⃣ How AMC Completes TFL

| TFL Component | Role    |
| ------------- | ------- |
| Curriculum    | Teach   |
| Assessment    | Measure |
| Recovery      | Repair  |
| AMC           | Sustain |

Now TFL becomes a **career-long system**, not a course.
