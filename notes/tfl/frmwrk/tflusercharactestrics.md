# Transflower Learning Framework (TFL)

## User Characteristics & Role-Based System Design

## 1. Introduction

The **Transflower Learning Framework (TFL)** is a skill-first, outcome-driven learning and assessment ecosystem designed to transform learners into industry-ready professionals. Unlike traditional Learning Management Systems (LMS) that focus on content delivery and attendance, TFL emphasizes **skill acquisition, continuous assessment, mentor guidance, and measurable growth**.

This document defines the **user characteristics, roles, expectations, and system design implications** for all stakeholders interacting with the TFL online assessment and learning platform.

## 2. Purpose of This Document

This design document serves to:

* Identify and categorize all user roles in the TFL ecosystem
* Define behavioral and functional characteristics of each role
* Establish design principles aligned with TFL philosophy
* Guide UI/UX, assessment engine, analytics, and governance layers
* Act as a reference for developers, curriculum architects, mentors, and administrators

## 3. TFL User Role Classification

TFL recognizes users as **evolving participants in a learning ecosystem**, not static system users.

| Role Category         | TFL Role Name                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Learners              | Skill Seekers → Skill Builders → Skill Performers |
| Instructors           | Skill Architects & Mentors                        |
| Administrators        | Learning System Governors                         |
| Support Staff         | Learning Enablement Facilitators                  |
| External Stakeholders | Observers, Validators & Influencers               |


## 4. Students (Primary Learners)

### 4.1 TFL Role

**Skill Seekers → Skill Builders → Skill Performers**

Students progress through structured skill maturity stages rather than semester-based promotion.

### 4.2 Key Characteristics

* **Diverse Backgrounds**

  * Academic: CS, non-CS, diploma, self-taught
  * Cultural and linguistic diversity
  * Varying access to digital infrastructure

* **Learning Style Variations**

  * Conceptual learners (why-first)
  * Visual learners (diagrams, flows)
  * Hands-on learners (labs, projects)
  * Reflective learners (feedback-driven)

* **Technological Proficiency**

  * Beginner → Tool-aware → Advanced
  * Mobile-first usage patterns

### 4.3 TFL Design Implications

* Skill-based navigation instead of subject-based
* Multi-format assessments:

  * MCQs (knowledge)
  * Coding challenges (application)
  * Scenario-based questions (analysis)
  * Projects (performance)
* Adaptive difficulty and remediation paths
* Continuous feedback via Skill Gym

### 4.4 TFL Outcome

Transform learners from **content consumers** into **job-ready skill owners**.

## 5. Instructors / Mentors

### 5.1 TFL Role

**Skill Architects & Learning Mentors**

Instructors define skill structures, mentor learners, and validate outcomes.

### 5.2 Key Characteristics

* Subject matter expertise
* Limited time for manual evaluation
* Strong pedagogical intent
* Focus on learning outcomes and employability

### 5.3 TFL Design Implications

* Skill → Sub-skill → Assessment blueprint
* AI-assisted question and test generation
* Auto-tagging of assessments by:

  * Skill
  * Cognitive level (Bloom’s taxonomy)
  * Industry relevance
* Mentor dashboards featuring:

  * Skill heatmaps
  * Learner progress analytics
  * Cohort comparisons

### 5.4 TFL Outcome

Enable instructors to operate as **mentors and system designers**, not clerical evaluators.

## 6. Administrators

### 6.1 TFL Role

**Learning System Governors**

Administrators ensure institutional alignment, compliance, and scalability.

### 6.2 Key Characteristics

* User and role management
* Curriculum governance
* Data-driven planning and reporting
* Compliance and security oversight

### 6.3 TFL Design Implications

* Institution-level dashboards
* Skill Readiness Index (SRI)
* Placement and employability reports
* Accreditation and audit-ready data exports
* Secure access control and data pipelines

### 6.4 TFL Outcome

Shift governance from **attendance tracking** to **skill-outcome governance**.


## 7. Support Staff

### 7.1 TFL Role

**Learning Enablement Facilitators**

Support staff ensure smooth adoption and continuous usability of the platform.

### 7.2 Key Characteristics

* Technical troubleshooting capability
* User onboarding and training responsibility
* Continuous improvement mindset

### 7.3 TFL Design Implications

* Role-specific simplified interfaces
* Guided workflows and walkthroughs
* Knowledge base and training playbooks
* Issue analytics for UX improvement

### 7.4 TFL Outcome

Minimize friction and maximize platform adoption.

## 8. External Stakeholders

### 8.1 Parents / Guardians

**Role:** Progress Observers

* Limited, privacy-respecting access
* Focus on growth indicators rather than raw scores

**TFL Support:**

* Skill growth summaries
* Readiness indicators
* Controlled access views

### 8.2 Regulatory Bodies & Accrediting Agencies

**Role:** Validators and Auditors

* Evidence-based evaluation
* Outcome traceability

**TFL Support:**

* Curriculum-to-skill mapping
* Assessment audit trails
* Benchmarking and compliance reports


## 9. Unified TFL User Experience Principles

| Principle        | Description                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Skill-first      | Every action maps to a skill         |
| Adaptive         | System responds to learner behavior  |
| Mentor-driven    | Human guidance amplified by AI       |
| Outcome-visible  | Growth is measurable and transparent |
| Industry-aligned | Skills map directly to job roles     |

## 10. Conclusion

Traditional learning systems ask:

> *"Who accessed the system and completed the course?"*

**Transflower Learning Framework asks:**

> *"Who grew, by how much, in which skill — and what is the next best action?"*

This document establishes the foundation for designing TFL’s assessment engine, analytics platform, mentor dashboards, and governance models.

**Document Status:** Approved – TFL Core Design
