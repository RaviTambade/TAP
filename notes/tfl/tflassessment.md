### **TFL Assessment: One Component of a Larger Ecosystem**

At present, many of you are working on the **TFL Assessment Project**.

It is important to understand this clearly:

> **TFL Assessment is only one part of the overall TFL ecosystem.**

Approximately **20–30%** of the complete system.

This module focuses on:

* Exams
* Scheduled assessments
* Test execution
* Result capture
* Assessment analytics

The insights generated from assessments help mentors and students:

* Align goals for the next day
* Adjust plans for the next week
* Redefine milestones for the next month

Assessment data becomes **input for adaptive learning**.

### **Placement Probability & Intervention Engine**

Now let us talk about one of the most critical components:
**Placement Probability and Intervention Engine**.

Consider a scenario:
* A student like Kajal has completed most of the TAP program
* Or Sarthak has built strong project experience

The mentor’s question now becomes:

> “Is this candidate ready for interviews?”

To answer this objectively, we define **placement readiness parameters**.

For example:

* If the readiness score crosses **75%**, the system may indicate interview readiness

This is not intuition-based.
This is **AI-assisted, data-driven decision-making**.

### **AI-Based Readiness Indicators**

The system evaluates multiple parameters and generates a **placement probability score**.

Based on this score, candidates are classified into:

* 🟢 **Green Zone** – Ready for placement
* 🟡 **Yellow Zone** – Needs improvement
* 🔴 **Red Zone** – Requires immediate intervention

This visual model enables:

* Mentors to design focused interventions
* Students to clearly understand their standing
* Organizations to trust the readiness signal

The goal is simple:

> Move every student from **Red → Yellow → Green**
