## 🌱 **“The Freedom My Parents Gave Me” *

> *By Ravi Tambade – Transflower Mentor*

My mother never went to school.
My father studied only till 4th standard.

Yet, they gave me something that many educated parents today don’t.git agit 

**Freedom.**

They never asked me:

* “What will you become?”
* “Why don’t you apply for a government job?”
* “What are you doing with your life?”

They stayed silent.

And that silence gave me space to grow.

When I was in college, in the 1990s, computers were still a curiosity in India.
Most families believed only one thing:

> “Get a government job. Life is settled.”

Many of my friends joined the police after 10th and 12th.
Others prepared for competitive exams.

But I was different.

I was obsessed with computers.

DOS.
Windows.
Win32 programs.

I wanted to know:
“How does this machine think?”

With my mentor, **Mr. Narendra**, I started learning how to write programs.
Not for marks.
Not for certificates.

For curiosity.

For joy.

Final year came.

Placement season.

My friends were getting:

* MNC offers
* Big packages
* Foreign travel
* Exciting careers

And where was I?

In a small computer institute…
Helping students learn C and C++.
Providing lab support.

No brand name.
No big salary.
No security.

I was scared.

I thought:
“Now my parents will panic.”

“They will say — Get a job. Enough is enough.”

But they didn’t.

They didn’t know what IT was.
They didn’t understand software.
They didn’t know about packages.

But they saw something.

I was serious.
Focused.
Not wasting time.

That was enough.

They trusted me.

Without understanding my path.

That kind of trust is rare today.

Today, I see educated parents controlling every step:

* Engineering college ✔️
* Backup MBA ✔️
* Infosys offer ✔️
* LinkedIn post at 22 ✔️

Everything planned.

Everything forced.

My parents had no playbook.

So they gave me space to write my own.

I was not a topper.
I had no powerful connections.
No shortcuts.

All I had was:

Time.
Freedom.
And strong values.

Discipline.
Hard work.
Responsibility.

They had already given me these.

The rest… I built myself.

Sometimes, the best thing a parent can do is…

Nothing.

No pressure.
No rescue.
No shortcuts.

Just:

Presence.
And quiet trust.

After narrating this story, you can conclude with:

> “Students, success is not about following a ready-made path.
> It is about discovering your own path — with discipline and patience.

> Your background does not decide your future.
> Your mindset does.

> Use your freedom wisely.
> Build skills.
> Respect time.
> Stay focused.

> And one day, your journey will become someone else’s inspiration.”
