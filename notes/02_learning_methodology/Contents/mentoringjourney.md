### 🌱 My Journey as a Mentor

When I look back, I see one constant thread: **teaching and mentoring in software development**.

There were moments when I was unsure, when people told me to just manage the show, stay behind the scenes, or move into overhead management. But I realized very early: *my passion is teaching, and teaching software development is where I belong.*

I’ve seen students like Subhina, Rajeshwar, Ani, and Meghna — each of them taking small steps, learning not just coding but patience, persistence, and the value of not giving up. Sometimes only 10% of them push through, sometimes just 1%, but that 1% is enough. That’s the seed we plant. 🌱

From the early days when I wrote my first blog in 2009, to today where more than 600+ learners have grown through this ecosystem, one thing is clear — **this is not just training; this is career transformation**.

Some of them are now working at IBM, some leading HR expansion plans, some exploring entrepreneurship. Each success story tells me I chose the right path.

I may not be the one coding every project anymore — but I’m here to step in, guide, and make sure no one feels lost. That’s what a mentor does.

And this journey is not mine alone. It’s about the people who trusted, stayed patient, and grew with us. That’s what keeps me going.

I see — you’re weaving in memories: **books like Scott Meyers’ Effective C++**, learning environments with limited resources, peer collaboration, labs, even the sound of drones in the background. It’s almost like you’re narrating a “slice of life” from your journey as a learner and later as a mentor.

Here’s how I can help you shape this into a **mentor reflection story** (something you could share with your students or community):


### 📖 From Books to Collaboration — My Journey with C++

When I was learning C++, I didn’t have the luxury of structured labs or endless resources. What I had were a few books — *Effective C++* and *More Effective C++* by Scott Meyers, which became my constant companions. I remember how every “item” in those books felt like a key opening a new door of thought.

We didn’t have Sedac labs or fancy IT setups. What we had was **collaboration**. Sitting in small groups, sometimes in noisy rooms where even drones flying outside could be heard, we kept learning. Someone had a laptop, someone else just a notebook, but together we built a *support system*.

That was my real lab — **the people around me**. We weren’t just coding; we were learning how to think, how to share, and how to grow as a community.

Later, when I became a mentor, I realized this truth:
👉 *Technology changes, but the collaborative mindset is timeless.*

You don’t always need a big institution or perfect setup. What you need is patience, a mentor, and a circle of learners who don’t give up. That’s how transformation happens.

 Ah, Ravi sir — I can see how you’re trying to stitch **your mentor journey, your students’ struggles, your own reflections, and the “growth mindset” philosophy** into one powerful narrative. It mixes Marathi, English, personal memories, and global references (Microsoft, Satya Nadella, Carol Dweck). Let me shape this raw flow into a **mentor-style speech** that you could use in your sessions or even as a keynote.


### 🌱 Mentor Talk: *From Fixed Mindset to Growth Mindset*

When I look back at my journey, it did not begin in air-conditioned labs with rows of new computers, ergonomic chairs, or 39,000-rupee facilities. It began in small spaces, with second-hand books, one or two machines, and a lot of *jidd* — determination.

We had no luxury, but we had hunger. And one lesson I quickly realized was this:
👉 **Teaching others is the fastest way of learning.**
When I explained a C++ pointer to my friend, it became clearer to me. When I guided someone through Windows programming, I became stronger in it myself.

Many of my students, some of whom got their very first jobs after struggling for months, are now successful — in IBM, Microsoft, startups, even leading their own companies. But success never came only from knowing syntax. It came from mindset.

Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, often speaks of moving from a **“know-it-all” culture to a “learn-it-all” culture**. That is exactly what Dr. Carol Dweck, the Stanford psychologist, calls a **growth mindset**.

👉 A **fixed mindset** says: *“I can’t do this, I failed, so I’m not good enough.”*
👉 A **growth mindset** says: *“I failed, so I learned, and I will try again — better.”*

In my own teaching, I’ve seen this. Some students give up at the first bug. Others stay, debug late at night, ask again, discuss with peers, and suddenly — breakthrough! Those who don’t give up, those who learn from failure, are the ones who transform.

So my message is simple:

* Don’t chase facilities, chase opportunities to learn.
* Don’t compare yourself with others, compare yourself with yesterday’s version of you.
* Don’t aim to “know it all”, aim to “learn it all”.

Because your brain already has 100 billion neurons. It just needs the right mindset to connect them.

And remember, if I could build a career, a community, and a company with so little, you too can build your future — with patience, mentorship, and a growth mindset.


## 🌱 Session Script: *Growth Mindset — Rewiring Your Brain for Success*

🔹 **Opening (Hook)**
“Do you know, inside your head you already carry **100 billion neurons**? Each neuron can connect to thousands of others — making **trillions of possible connections**. That means your brain is literally built for growth, adaptation, and creativity. The question is not whether you are intelligent — the question is: *Are you using a growth mindset or a fixed mindset?*



🔹 **Fixed vs Growth Mindset**

* A **fixed mindset** says: *‘I am from a rural area, I don’t have good facilities, my English is weak, I cannot compete.’*
* A **growth mindset** says: *‘I may not know it now, but with persistence, learning, and mentorship, I can grow.’*



🔹 **Relevance to Career**
Today’s organizations don’t just look at degrees. Many companies hire people from so-called rural backgrounds and small colleges — but the difference is **attitude**.

📌 Attitude is everything.
📌 Persistence beats talent.
📌 Skills can be learned, but mindset decides growth.


🔹 **Examples & Inspiration**

* **Nick Vujicic**, born without arms and legs, became one of the world’s highest-paid motivational speakers. Why? Not because of body, but because of mindset.
* **Satya Nadella**, CEO of Microsoft, shifted the company from a *know-it-all* culture to a *learn-it-all* culture. That is growth mindset in action.



🔹 **Practical Takeaway**

1. **Rewire your brain** → Every failure is a lesson. Treat it as feedback.
2. **Practice persistence** → Keep trying one more time when others give up.
3. **Collaborate & Mentor** → Teaching others strengthens your own learning.
4. **Celebrate small wins** → Growth is step by step, neuron by neuron.


🔹 **Closing (Impact line)**
“Your career, your future, your life is not written by your background — it is written by your mindset. Remember this: *You don’t need to know it all. You just need to learn it all.* That is the seed of success.” 🌱



## ✨ Mentor–Student Journey Narrative (Refined)

🔹 **Ankur’s Sharing (condensed & heartfelt)**
“Down the line of experiences, many things helped me a lot. Eventually I jumped to the Java stack, and within a year I was able to achieve growth and even a promotion. Honestly, this is all because of Ravi Sir’s guidance. That’s why today I came here with my wife and daughter — because this isn’t just about my career, it’s about the family-like support I received.

Till now, all our interactions had been online. I’m originally from Jharkhand, so during my learning journey I used to connect remotely. Today is the very first time I’m meeting Sir and this community physically, here in Pune. That itself is very special for me.”


🔹 **Mentor’s Reflection (connecting past & present)**
“I remember back in the early 2000s when we started — students like Ankur would attend sessions, do practicals, and keep learning in spite of limitations. Some of them came from electronics, some from B.Sc., some from small towns.

At that time, we didn’t have a big setup, but we had a **spirit of learning and collaboration**. That’s what mattered. For example, Nilesh, who started in those days, is now the **Technical Director at Sanding**, like a CTO. Many others too have moved ahead and become leaders, founders, or mentors themselves.”


🔹 **Closing Note (community spirit)**
“This is what gives me happiness — not just seeing one product or one company grow, but seeing how so many students, mentees, and professionals have grown into leaders.

The vision has always been simple: *when you grow, you also lift others with you.* That’s why we want you all to keep visiting, keep connecting, and keep contributing. Because this is not just about careers — it’s about building a community of growth.”

I understand, sir 👍. What you’ve shared is really two things interwoven:

1. **Your pride in alumni & mentees** — people like Sudhit Patek, Prashant, and many others who not only grew in their careers but even launched their own companies.
2. **The milestone moment** — celebrating Teacher’s Day + Transflower Foundation Day with the launch of the website (a gift from your family, supported by AI tools).

Here’s a refined **speech draft** you could use on such an occasion, keeping the authenticity of your words but giving it a flowing structure:
