## 🌱 First: Reframe What “Problem Solving” Means
Problem-solving is the *real* skill behind every good developer, architect, or mentor. 🌱

Let me guide you in a **Transflower Learning Framework way**—practical, disciplined, and human.


Problem solving is **not**:

* Knowing more syntax
* Memorizing algorithms
* Jumping straight to code

Problem solving **is**:

> Understanding the problem deeply before touching the keyboard.

Most people rush to *solutions*.
Strong problem solvers **slow down at the problem**.

## 🧠 The Transflower Problem-Solving Ladder

### 🪜 Level 1: Learn to *See* the Problem (Clarity)

Before coding, always answer:

1. **What is the problem really asking?**
2. **Who is affected?**
3. **What does success look like?**
4. **What is NOT required?**

📝 *Exercise (Daily – 5 min)*
Take any problem and write:

* Input
* Output
* Constraints
* Assumptions

No code. Just thinking.


### 🪜 Level 2: Break It Down (Decomposition)

Big problems are just **small problems hiding together**.

Example:

> “Build a banking system”

Break it into:

* Account creation
* Balance inquiry
* Deposit
* Withdraw
* Validation
* Error handling

🎯 Rule:

> If you can’t explain it in steps, you don’t understand it yet.

### 🪜 Level 3: Think in Examples (Concrete Thinking)

Before logic, test with **real values**.

Example:

* Balance = 5,000
* Withdraw = 6,000
* Expected result = ❌ Error

Ask:

* What edge cases exist?
* What can go wrong?

🧠 This step separates **average coders** from **strong thinkers**.


### 🪜 Level 4: Choose the Simplest Tool First

Ask yourself:

* Can this be solved with `if`?
* With a loop?
* With an array?
* With a map or object?

🚫 Do NOT start with:

* Design patterns
* Complex architecture
* Clever tricks

> Simple solutions that work beat clever solutions that confuse.


### 🪜 Level 5: Explain Before You Code

Say your solution **out loud** (or write it):

> “If the account is active and balance is sufficient, deduct amount, else throw error.”

If you can explain it like this, coding becomes trivial.


## 🧩 The Daily 30-Minute Problem-Solving Routine

⏱ **30 minutes. Every day. No excuses.**

### ⏰ 10 min – Understand

* Read the problem
* Write inputs, outputs, constraints

### ⏰ 10 min – Design

* Steps
* Flow
* Edge cases

### ⏰ 10 min – Code + Reflect

* Write code
* Ask: *Could this be simpler?*


## 🏦 Practice Using Real Domains (This Is Key)

Abstract problems are hard.
**Domain problems train the brain better.**

Use domains like:

* Banking (accounts, transactions)
* E-commerce (cart, checkout, discounts)
* School system (students, marks, grades)

Example problem:

> “Prevent withdrawal if daily limit exceeded.”

This forces:

* Logic
* State tracking
* Constraints

## 🧠 Mental Models That Will Level You Up

Remember these always:

* **Input → Process → Output**
* **Happy path first, then failures**
* **State + Transition**
* **Rules before code**


## 🚫 Common Mistakes (Avoid These)

❌ Jumping to code
❌ Copy-pasting solutions
❌ Chasing advanced topics too early
❌ Measuring progress by speed

> Speed comes **after** clarity, not before.

## 🌿 Transflower Mentor Truth

> “Good problem solvers are not fast thinkers.
> They are calm thinkers.”
