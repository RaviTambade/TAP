## Teaching Problem Solving through E‑Commerce Mini‑Projects

> **Mentor Principle:** We don’t teach coding first. We teach *thinking in systems*.
> E‑commerce is familiar, concrete, and full of real-world constraints — perfect for problem solving.


## 🧭 How to Use This Workbook

For **every mini‑project**, students must follow this order:

1. Understand the business problem
2. Identify inputs, outputs, and rules
3. List assumptions & edge cases
4. Design logic in plain English
5. Only then → write code

## 🧠 Problem‑Solving Reflection (Mandatory)

After each mini‑project:

1. What was the **core business rule**?
2. What assumptions did I make?
3. What edge cases surprised me?
4. How would this fail at scale?


## 🌿 Mentor’s Closing Note

> *Strong developers don’t rush to frameworks.*
> *They slow down, understand the business, and design logic that survives reality.*

Master these e‑commerce mini‑projects and you will:

* Think like a product engineer
* Communicate better in interviews
* Design systems, not just functions

## 🧠 Mentor Solutions (Thinking, Not Code)

> These are **how a mentor reasons**, not how a developer writes syntax. Students should compare *their thinking* with this — not copy it.



### Mini-Project 1: Product Search & Filtering

#### 🎓 Junior-Level Thinking

* First clarify **what problem the user has**: “I want to find a product quickly.”
* Identify **inputs**: search text, selected category, price range.
* Identify **output**: list of products that match conditions.
* Apply filters **one by one** (search → category → price).
* Assume clean data and happy paths.

> Focus: correctness over performance

#### 🧑‍💼 Mid-Level Thinking

* Ask: *What happens if filters conflict or return zero results?*
* Decide filter **order** (cheapest operation first).
* Think about **partial matches** ("shoe" vs "shoes").
* Handle missing values (price = null, category = unknown).
* Separate concerns: search logic ≠ UI ≠ data source.

> Focus: user experience + maintainability

#### 🧠 Senior-Level Thinking

* Ask: *How does this behave at scale (1M products)?*
* Decide between **precomputed indexes vs runtime filtering**.
* Consider personalization (user history influences ranking).
* Handle abuse (expensive queries, wildcards).
* Define SLAs: response time, consistency, fallback behavior.

> Focus: scalability, resilience, and business impact

### Mini-Project 2: Cart & Pricing Engine

#### 🎓 Junior-Level Thinking

* Cart = list of items + quantity.
* Price = sum(item price × quantity).
* Apply discount after total is calculated.
* Simple assumption: one discount at a time.

> Focus: basic arithmetic + flow

#### 🧑‍💼 Mid-Level Thinking

* Clarify **pricing rules**: stackable vs exclusive discounts.
* Think about **state changes**: add, update, remove item.
* Consider rounding, currency, tax separation.
* Validate inputs (negative quantity, expired coupon).

> Focus: business rules & correctness under change

#### 🧠 Senior-Level Thinking

* Treat pricing as a **rule engine**, not if-else logic.
* Make pricing **deterministic & auditable**.
* Think about concurrency (two tabs modifying cart).
* Separate displayed price vs charged price.
* Prepare for future rules without rewrites.

> Focus: extensibility, trust, and financial accuracy

---

### Mini-Project 3: Order Lifecycle Management

#### 🎓 Junior-Level Thinking

* Order states: Created → Paid → Shipped → Delivered.
* Update status step by step.
* Prevent skipping steps.

> Focus: linear flow

#### 🧑‍💼 Mid-Level Thinking

* Model order as a **state machine**.
* Handle failures: payment success but shipping failure.
* Allow retries without duplication.
* Log transitions for debugging.

> Focus: reliability & recovery

#### 🧠 Senior-Level Thinking

* Orders are **legal and financial records**.
* Make transitions idempotent.
* Separate command (intent) from event (fact).
* Design for partial fulfillment & cancellations.
* Ensure observability (metrics, alerts).

> Focus: correctness under chaos

## 🧩 Mentor Reflection Prompts (Use After Every Project)

* What assumptions did I make?
* What breaks first at scale?
* What would I change if business rules double?
* Where would bugs hide?
* How would I explain this to a non-technical stakeholder?

> **Transflower Principle:**
> Problem-solving is not about knowing answers — it’s about *knowing what questions to ask next.*
