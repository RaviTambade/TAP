### What this workbook trains


This workbook is intentionally **language-agnostic** and **thinking-first**, so it sharpens *problem-solving*, not just coding.

* 🧠 **Problem decomposition** (inputs, rules, outputs)
* ⚖️ **Decision logic & edge-case thinking**
* 🏗️ **Real-world system reasoning**
* 💬 Clear explanation before implementation

### Domains covered

* 🏦 **Banking** – balances, limits, interest, compliance
* 🛡️ **Insurance** – eligibility, premiums, claims
* 🏥 **Healthcare** – appointments, risk, dosage
* 🛒 **E-commerce** – cart, orders, returns
* 🎟️ **Ticket Booking** – seats, fares, refunds

Each assignment is crafted to feel like **actual business logic**, not textbook puzzles.

### How I recommend using it

* Give **1–2 assignments per day**
* Force students to write:

  * assumptions
  * edge cases
  * plain-English logic
* Code only *after* reasoning is reviewed

### I can extend this further if you want

* 🔁 Add **difficulty levels (Junior / Mid / Senior)**
* 🧪 Add **test-case design tasks**
* 🧩 Convert into **weekly challenge format**
* 🧑‍🏫 Add **mentor solution notes**
* 📘 Merge with your **30-day problem-solving workbook**

Just tell me how this will be used — **self-study, classroom, interviews, or mentoring program** 🌿
