# Full Stack Dot Net Developer Journey

### 🚀 Welcome to the Transflower Acceleration Program (TAP)
 
> *“Dear Learner, don’t just learn how to code. Learn how to **solve problems**, **work in a team**, and **ship real products** — that’s what makes you a developer the industry trusts.”*

That’s what I tell every student who walks into our **.NET Full Stack Developer Bootcamp**.

This isn’t a 20-day crash module of a coure where you memorize syntax and forget it the next day.
This is **TAP** — where we transform curious learners into **project-ready, production-worthy professionals**.

Let me walk you through this journey.

## 🛠️ Phase 1: Think Like an Engineer

Before you touch a single line of code, you must understand the **why** and **how** of software.

### 📘 Software Engineering

We begin with the **Software Development Life Cycle**. You’ll learn how real companies build software from scratch — from **requirement gathering to SRS documentation**.

Why? Because a developer who can write clean code *and* understand a client’s vision is rare — and valuable.

## 🤝 Phase 2: Teamwork Makes the Dream Work

Welcome to the **real world** — where development is **collaborative**, and **Git is your best friend**.

### 🔧 Collaborative Development with Git & GitHub

You’ll learn:

* How to **work in a dev team**
* Use Git commands, GitHub features
* Understand real-world **Git workflows**

Because in the industry, it’s not just about building features — it’s about not breaking the team’s work while doing it.

## 🔄 Phase 3: Go Agile or Go Home

You’ll master the **Agile mindset**. The industry runs on sprints, not marathons.

### ⚡ Agile Methodology

* Agile Manifesto
* Scrum ceremonies
* CI/CD concepts
* Test Automation with Selenium IDE

> This is where we introduce you to the rhythm of professional development.

## 🧠 Phase 4: Learn to Talk to Data

You’ll become fluent in **SQL** and **database design**.

### 🗄️ Database Systems & Data Access

* ER diagrams, DDL & DML
* Stored Procedures, Triggers
* ORM using Entity Framework Core
* Connected & Disconnected Data Access

Why? Because full stack developers don’t just build UIs. They **architect data flows** that drive business.

## 💻 Phase 5: Master the .NET Core

You’ll build scalable, modern applications using **C# and ASP.NET Core**.

### 🧱 C# Essentials

* OOP, Delegates, Events
* File I/O, JSON, Reflection
* Advanced features like garbage collection, LINQ, async/await

### 🌐 Web Development with ASP.NET Core

* MVC & Razor Pages
* Middleware & DI
* Secure REST APIs
* JWT authentication

You will not just *see* concepts — you'll *use* them to build real features.


## 🌍 Phase 6: Front-End Development

You’ll learn **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and modern frameworks like:

### ⚛️ React | 🅰️ Angular | 💡 Node.js

Why all three? Because each has its place — and we train you to **pick the right tool for the problem**.

You’ll build responsive, interactive apps with:

* Axios, fetch, DOM handling
* SPA routing, Redux, RxJS
* Component lifecycle management

## 📦 Phase 7: Best Practices & Architecture

You’ll learn **Clean Code principles**, **Design Patterns**, and **Microservices Architecture**.

> This is where you level up from a coder to a **software craftsman**.

You’ll work with:

* RabbitMQ, gRPC, Kafka
* Microservices with API Gateway
* Cloud-ready deployment

## ✅ Phase 8: Testing, Linux & DevOps

You’ll set up test cases, automation, and pipelines.

* Use **NUnit, Jasmine, Karma**
* Understand **TDD** and **STLC**
* Write **unit and integration tests**
* Automate using **Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps**

Plus, gain **Linux skills** every full stack developer needs for containerization and deployment.

## ☁️ Phase 9: Docker, Kubernetes & the Cloud

We teach you **how to dockerize your app**, deploy to **Kubernetes**, and understand **cloud infrastructure**.

No more fear of “cloud” — you'll feel right at home pushing to **AWS, Azure, or GCP**.

## 🧠 Phase 10: DSA with C\#

Learn **Data Structures and Algorithms** using the same language you’re building projects with — C#.

* Arrays, Lists, Trees, Graphs
* Sorting & Searching
* Problem solving with .NET efficiency
 
## 🎤 Final Phase: Interview Prep

You’ll enter interviews **not just prepared — but practiced**.

* Mock Interviews
* System Design Discussions
* Resume Building with Real Project Experience


## 🎓 What You’ll Leave With:

- ✅ 3+ Full Stack Projects
- ✅ GitHub Portfolio
- ✅ Cloud-Deployed Apps
- ✅ Confidence to ace interviews
- ✅ Skills to build your own startup MVP if you choose
