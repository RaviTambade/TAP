🌸 **The Transflower Way of Hiring** 🌸

*(The classroom is silent. The mentor stands by the board, hands in pockets, smiling gently as he looks at the students.)*

> “Let me tell you something that surprises most people who walk into Transflower for an interview,”
> he begins.
> “We don’t start by asking, *Which language do you know?*
> We start by asking, *What kind of person are you?*”

He writes on the board:

> **‘Attitude before Aptitude.’**


### 🌼 The Mentor continues:

“At **Transflower**, if I interview you, I don’t care which framework or language you use —
C#, Java, Python, Angular, React… it doesn’t matter.

Because tools can be *taught.*
What I really want to know is —
how you *think*, how you *care*, and how you *connect*.”

He turns to the class and asks softly:

> “When you join a project team, what do you bring first — your code or your character?”

The students smile — they know the answer.


### 🌿 The Transflower Hiring Philosophy

> “Here’s what we really care about,” he says, writing three points on the board:

1. 🌱 **How you treat people** —
   Do you listen before speaking? Do you respect your teammates, testers, and customers?
   Because teamwork is not a skill — it’s a culture.

2. 🔍 **Your curiosity to learn** —
   When you don’t know something, do you ask *why*?
   When something breaks, do you explore or complain?
   Because curiosity is the engine of progress.

3. 💖 **Your empathy and broad interests** —
   Can you imagine the user’s frustration?
   Can you sense your teammate’s stress before a deadline?
   Because empathy creates great engineers — not syntax.


### 🌻 Mentor smiles:

“If you are good at these three things,” he says,
“you are already hired.
Because we can teach you everything else —
Frameworks, databases, APIs, deployment pipelines — those are trainable.”

He pauses.

> “But one thing we *cannot* teach,” he says firmly,
> “is how **not to be a jerk.**”

The class laughs. But they understand.
This isn’t just humor — it’s truth.


### 🌸 The Transflower Rule

> “Never hire based on tech stack.
> Hire people with:
>
> * 🌼 **Curiosity** — the hunger to explore,
> * 🌺 **Empathy** — the heart to understand,
> * 🌿 **Diverse interests** — the ability to connect ideas across worlds.
>
> Because everything else,” he says, tapping the board,
> “can be fixed with training and mentoring.”


### 🌷 Mentor’s Closing Words:

“At Transflower, we don’t just build software —
we grow people.
We believe that character shapes code,
and empathy powers innovation.

So when you walk into an interview — don’t bring your résumé first.
Bring your curiosity.
Bring your kindness.
Bring your *yet.*”

He smiles and concludes:

> “Because when good people grow together,
> technology becomes beautiful.”

Tap your potential.
