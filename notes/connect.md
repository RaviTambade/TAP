I’m **Ravi Tambade**, Founder of **Transflower Learning**, and I thought it was the right time to share a little more about who I am, what I care about, and why Transflower exists.

Twelve years ago, I noticed a gap: many IT training institutes could teach software development, but very few truly understood **how people learn**. Universities, EdTech startups, and training companies were being offered “generic” courses—when what they needed were **domain-driven, tailored learning experiences**.

That’s why I started **Transflower**.

We specialize in **IT project-based learning**—not just teaching skills, but preparing individuals to become **project-ready IT professionals**. Our teams combine **education expertise** with **technology know-how** to design learning experiences that work in the real world.

We focus on **skill-based learning** for individuals and companies who need results, not experiments.

The result? A **high-quality, project-ready talent pool** that companies trust and rely on.

But beyond business, here’s what drives me:

* **Education as an equalizer:** Technology can make learning more accessible, fair, and impactful.
* **Craftsmanship in mentoring:** Delivering depth and integrity, never cutting corners.
* **Long-term impact:** Success is measured not just in revenue, but in the lives and careers we transform.

I keep exploring upcoming technologies, processes, and tools—because building truly **impactful IT professionals** requires staying ahead, hands-on, and continuously learning.

As Transflower grows, I’d love to connect with **fellow founders, educators, and tech leaders** who share this vision. If you’re building in the education or training space, let’s talk—we might be able to **create something meaningful together**.
