# 🎓 Placement Readiness Certificate
Below is a **clear, formal, mentor-approved definition** of the
**Placement Readiness Certificate Criteria**
designed **specifically as per the Transflower Learning Framework (TFL)**.
## **Transflower Learning Framework (TFL)**

> **Purpose:**
> To certify that a learner is **industry-ready**, **project-capable**, and **interview-confident**, not merely trained.

## 🧭 Core Philosophy (TLF Alignment)

**Transflower Learning Framework believes:**

> ❝ Skills are proven by execution, not attendance ❞

Therefore, the certificate is awarded **only after evidence-based evaluation** across **Knowledge + Skills + Behavior**.
