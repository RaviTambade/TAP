# 3-Year Parallel Confidence-Building Syllabus

### (Designed to run **alongside** Indian Engineering Degrees)

> **Purpose**: This syllabus does **not replace** the university curriculum.
> It runs in parallel to **convert theory into confidence, capability, and career readiness**.

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES (Read This First)

* 📘 University syllabus = *What to study*
* 🧠 Parallel syllabus = *How to think, apply, and grow*
* 🏗️ Focus on **foundations → systems → ownership**
* 🎯 Outcome-driven, not marks-driven
* 🤝 Mentorship + peer learning is compulsory
