- <a href="https://github.com/RaviTambade/InventoryManagement.git">Inventory Management Portal</a>

During my TAP Internship (Project Readiness Program), I've been involved in various aspects of software development, particularly focusing on requirement gathering, design system implementation, and database design for TFLAssessment, TFLPortal, Inventory Management Systems for Manifacturing WareHouse, the EKrushi portal and EAgro Services.

**Requirement Gathering and Design System**
I have extensive experience in gathering requirements from stakeholders and translating them into actionable design specifications. For the Inventory Management System, TFLPortal portal, I conducted thorough interviews and discussions with clients to understand their needs and preferences. Based on these requirements, I developed comprehensive design systems that outlined the structure, functionality, and user interface elements of the applications.

**Database Design using RDBMS Concepts**
A crucial aspect of designing robust applications is establishing a well-structured database schema using MySql Database. Leveraging my knowledge of relational database management systems (RDBMS) concepts, I designed the databases for the , TFLPoratl, EKrushi portal and Inventory Management System. This involved creating entity-relationship, defining tables, relationships, constraints, and ensuring data integrity.

**Organizing EKrushi and Inventory Management Application using Layered Architecture**
To ensure maintainability, scalability, and separation of concerns, I organized the EKrushi and Inventory Management applications using a layered architecture approach. This architectural pattern facilitated modular development, allowing for independent development and testing of components such as presentation, business logic, and data access layers.

**Implementing Reusable REST APIs**
In developing the backend functionality for the EKrushi portal and Inventory Management System, I implemented reusable REST APIs using ASP.NET Core MVC and Web API. These APIs provided a standardized interface for interacting with the applications, enabling seamless integration with frontend components and external systems.

**Designing & Implementing Single Page Application User Interface using Angular**
For the frontend user interface of the EKrushi and Inventory Management applications, I employed Angular to develop responsive, dynamic, and intuitive single-page applications (SPAs). This involved designing user interfaces, implementing client-side logic, and integrating with backend APIs to deliver a seamless user experience.

**Coding using C#, REST API Development using ASP.NET Core**
I extensively utilized C# for backend development and REST API development using ASP.NET Core. Leveraging the features of ASP.NET Core, I implemented robust and performant APIs that adhered to industry standards and best practices.

**Database Programming using MySQL Scripts, Stored Procedures**
In addition to designing database schemas, I also performed database programming tasks using MySQL. This included writing SQL scripts, stored procedures, and business analytics queries to manage and manipulate data efficiently.

**Applying Best Practices and Software Design Principles**
Throughout the development process, I adhered to software design principles and coding conventions to ensure the readability, maintainability, and extensibility of the codebase. By applying best practices, I aimed to deliver high-quality solutions that met the client's requirements and expectations.

**Team Collaboration and Coordination**
I actively participated in team collaboration activities, including code reviews, pair programming, and knowledge sharing sessions. Additionally, I coordinated with cross-functional teams, including the procedure team, to validate that the developed code aligned with the client's requirements and business objectives.

**Implementation**: Using technologies such as React.js for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend, I developed the wishlist functionality from scratch. This involved creating RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on wishlist items, integrating with the existing user authentication system, and ensuring data persistence using a relational database like PostgreSQL.

**Testing and Quality Assurance**: Throughout the development process, I conducted rigorous testing to ensure the feature's functionality, performance, and security. I wrote unit tests for backend APIs using tools like Jest and Supertest, as well as end-to-end tests for the frontend using tools like Cypress. Additionally, I collaborated with QA engineers to perform manual testing and address any reported issues promptly.

**Deployment and Launch**: After completing development and testing, I worked with the DevOps team to deploy the feature to the staging environment for final validation. Once approved, I assisted in deploying the feature to the production environment, ensuring a smooth and seamless rollout to users.

**Impact**: The wishlist feature was well-received by users, leading to a significant increase in user engagement and conversion rates. It provided a valuable tool for users to track and manage their favorite products, enhancing their overall shopping experience on the platform.

**Recognition and Future Opportunities**: My contributions to the wishlist feature project were recognized by the development team and management. I received positive feedback for my dedication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills throughout the internship. As a result, I was offered a full-time position as a Junior Developer upon completion of my internship, allowing me to continue contributing to the company's success and furthering my career in software development.
