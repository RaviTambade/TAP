**Summary:**

During my involvement in various software development projects, I focused on requirement gathering, design system implementation, and database design for systems such as TFLAssessment, TFLPortal, Inventory Management Systems for Manufacturing Warehouse, EKrushi portal, and EAgro Services.

**1. Requirement Gathering and Design System:**
I gathered requirements from stakeholders and translated them into actionable design specifications. For projects like the Inventory Management System and TFLPortal, I conducted interviews and discussions with clients to understand their needs and preferences, developing comprehensive design systems to outline the structure, functionality, and user interface elements.

**2. Database Design using RDBMS Concepts:**
I designed well-structured database schemas using MySQL, focusing on entity-relationship modeling, defining tables, relationships, constraints, and ensuring data integrity for projects like TFLAssessment, TFLPortal, EKrushi portal, and Inventory Management System.

**3. Organizing Applications using Layered Architecture:**
I organized applications using a layered architecture approach to ensure maintainability, scalability, and separation of concerns. This facilitated modular development, independent testing of components, and better organization of presentation, business logic, and data access layers.

**4. Implementing Reusable REST APIs:**
For backend functionality, I implemented reusable REST APIs using ASP.NET Core MVC and Web API. These APIs provided standardized interfaces for interacting with applications, enabling seamless integration with frontend components and external systems.

**5. Designing & Implementing Single Page Application User Interface using Angular:**
For frontend user interfaces, I utilized Angular to develop responsive, dynamic, and intuitive single-page applications (SPAs). This involved designing interfaces, implementing client-side logic, and integrating with backend APIs to deliver seamless user experiences for EKrushi and Inventory Management applications.

**6. Coding using C#, REST API Development using ASP.NET Core:**
I extensively used C# for backend development and REST API development using ASP.NET Core, implementing robust and performant APIs that adhered to industry standards and best practices.

**7. Database Programming using MySQL Scripts, Stored Procedures:**
In addition to designing database schemas, I performed database programming tasks using MySQL, including writing SQL scripts, stored procedures, and business analytics queries to manage and manipulate data efficiently.

**8. Applying Best Practices and Software Design Principles:**
Throughout development, I adhered to software design principles and coding conventions to ensure readability, maintainability, and extensibility of the codebase, aiming to deliver high-quality solutions that met client requirements and expectations.

**9. Team Collaboration and Coordination:**
I actively participated in team collaboration activities, including code reviews, pair programming, and knowledge sharing sessions. Additionally, I coordinated with cross-functional teams to validate that developed code aligned with client requirements and business objectives.

**Impact:**
My contributions to projects like the wishlist feature for e-Krishi platforms resulted in significant improvements in user engagement and conversion rates. Positive feedback and recognition from the development team and management led to future opportunities and a full-time position as a Junior Developer.

This summary highlights my experience and contributions in software development @Transflower, emphasizing key skills in requirement gathering, design, development, and collaboration, leading to successful project outcomes and career advancement opportunities.
