 

## Why New Graduates Should Opt for Skill-First, Project-Based Learning in Small Companies Over Multinational Training Programs

#### 1. **Real-World Experience vs. Theoretical Training**

In a small company, you are likely to be involved in all aspects of a project, from the planning phase to deployment. This hands-on experience allows you to learn **practical skills** that are directly relevant to your career. In contrast, in a larger multinational company, you may spend the first few months or even years in training programs or on the "bench" (waiting for a project to assign you). This means you could be spending a significant amount of time without learning or contributing to live projects.

#### 2. **Exposure to Different Phases of a Project**

In smaller companies, you are often tasked with working on various stages of a project, such as:

* **Requirement gathering and analysis**: Understanding the problem the project will solve.
* **Design and architecture**: Participating in designing the solution and structuring the system.
* **Development**: Writing code, debugging, and implementing features.
* **Testing**: Ensuring the solution works as expected through testing and quality assurance.
* **Deployment and Maintenance**: Deploying the solution and performing maintenance and updates.

This exposure gives you a **360-degree understanding** of how projects are managed and executed, helping you build **cross-functional expertise**. In contrast, in large companies, you might be siloed into one aspect of the project (e.g., just writing code or working only on testing), which can limit your broader understanding of the project lifecycle.

#### 3. **Skill Development in Real-Time**

Working in a small company means you're exposed to a wide variety of tasks and challenges. This forces you to **think critically** and **solve real-world problems** on the fly. In larger companies, because of their structured nature, you might only get to focus on one narrow task, and your exposure to new technologies, frameworks, or business problems may be limited.

Additionally, because you’ll be taking on multiple roles, your **soft skills** such as communication, time management, and teamwork are developed naturally. You learn how to balance different priorities and work under pressure, which is an invaluable skill.

#### 4. **Quicker Feedback and Learning**

In smaller teams, you are more likely to get direct feedback from senior team members or even the company's founder. This feedback loop allows for **faster learning** and improvement. You get to learn from your mistakes and apply that knowledge immediately, unlike larger organizations where feedback can be delayed or lost in layers of hierarchy.

Furthermore, smaller teams are more agile and can pivot quickly when something isn't working, which helps you learn how to adapt to changing requirements and conditions. You may also have more responsibility and ownership of your work, which gives you a deeper sense of accomplishment and pride.

#### 5. **Opportunities for Growth and Visibility**

In a small company, **your contributions matter** more directly. The projects you work on are often seen by the entire company, and sometimes even clients. As a result, your work has a visible impact, and your growth can be noticed much faster. In large corporations, with their vast number of employees and processes, it can take longer to be noticed, and your work might not have the same level of direct impact.

Moreover, small companies often have flatter organizational structures, which means that you’ll have access to more senior leaders, decision-makers, and mentors who can guide your career and help you grow professionally.

#### 6. **Flexibility and Learning Adaptability**

A small company tends to have a **more flexible environment**, which allows you to learn and adapt to new technologies or methodologies faster. Whether it’s adopting new programming languages, frameworks, or project management techniques, smaller teams are often quicker to experiment and innovate. This level of flexibility can be extremely beneficial for developing a broad range of skills.

On the other hand, in large companies, you might be stuck using the same stack of technologies for a long time, making it harder to diversify your skill set early on.

#### 7. **Building a Portfolio Early On**

When working in a small company, you can quickly build a **portfolio of work** that showcases a variety of projects and technologies. This gives you concrete proof of your skills and makes you more attractive to future employers. In multinational companies, you might only work on specific projects or tasks, which may not offer the same level of variety or exposure to diverse tools and technologies.

#### 8. **Entrepreneurial Mindset**

Smaller companies often have a culture of wearing multiple hats and being resourceful. Working in such an environment encourages you to take initiative, solve problems creatively, and think like an entrepreneur. This can significantly improve your **problem-solving and critical thinking** skills. You learn to approach problems from a business and technical perspective, preparing you for more senior roles in the future.

Large companies, on the other hand, may encourage a more **specialized** and **structured** approach, which can limit your entrepreneurial growth and creativity early in your career.

#### 9. **Faster Career Advancement**

Since smaller companies typically have fewer employees, your **career trajectory** can be much faster. You’ll likely be recognized for your hard work sooner, and there might be opportunities to take on more responsibility or move into higher positions quickly. In large companies, promotions and growth often depend on complex hierarchies, which can slow down your career progression.

### Conclusion: Focus on Skill-First Learning

For new graduates, the most valuable asset in today’s job market is **real-world experience**.

By actively participating in the full project lifecycle, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of how software is developed and deployed, allowing you to grow your skills quickly and effectively.

**Start with skill-first, project-based learning**. This approach will give you the foundation you need to succeed in any company, large or small, and set you on the path to becoming a highly skilled, versatile developer.
