ðŸŒ¸ Restart Your Career with Confidence | A Mentorship Program for Women in Tech


Dear Professionals,

Taking a career break is not a setback â€” itâ€™s simply a pause. What matters is how you restart, with confidence and clarity.

Iâ€™m excited to announce the launch of **Restart with Confidence â€“ A TAP(Transflower Accleration Program) Mentorship Program for Women Returning to Work**.

This initiative is designed to **support talented women professionals** who are ready to re-enter the IT workforce after a career break. Whether your break was six months or several years, this program will help you **refresh your skills, rebuild your confidence, and reconnect with industry opportunities**.


### ðŸŒŸ What the Program Offers

* **Personalized Mentorship** â€“ 1:1 guidance and weekly check-ins.
* **Skill Refresher Tracks** â€“ C#, Java, Python, Web, Cloud, or Data (based on your background).
* **Hands-On Projects** â€“ Build real-world apps and create a GitHub portfolio.
* **Career Rebuilding** â€“ Resume, LinkedIn profile, and interview preparation.
* **Peer & Alumni Network** â€“ Connect with women professionals on the same journey.

* Women with **2+ years of prior IT work experience**.
* A **career break of 6 months or more**.
* Strong passion to **restart their careers** and embrace new technologies.

 

### ðŸš€ Why This Program?

While companies like Infosys have launched commendable initiatives to **boost female workforce participation**, this program goes one step further by focusing on **mentorship and transformation**.
Here, the reward is not a referral bonus â€” itâ€™s the **joy of seeing women rebuild careers, confidence, and leadership potential**.
