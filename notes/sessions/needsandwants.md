## 🌱 Gen Z Debt & Financial Awareness

> “A few days ago, I met a young professional in Pune. She had just bought her third smartphone on EMI. When I asked her about her savings, she laughed—‘Savings? That’s old school. Why save when I can just pay in installments?’
> That day, I realized something alarming. India’s Gen Z isn’t just borrowing for emergencies—they’re borrowing to live life the way social media tells them to.”

Good morning everyone. Today, I want to talk about **a silent crisis affecting Gen Z in India: the debt culture**. And how students and parents can navigate it together.

### **The Reality of Gen Z Debt**

* **Unsecured loans are booming**—not for houses or cars, but for **experiences, gadgets, and lifestyle visibility**.
* Examples:

  * Flight tickets, concerts, reels = financed by loans
  * 70% of iPhones sold in India are bought on EMIs
  * Monthly expenses like rent, groceries, and utilities are being paid via short-term credit

**Key Insight:** Borrowing feels like a checkout option, not a financial obligation.

### **Why This Shift Happened**

#### 1️⃣ Housing is Broken

* Metro EMIs: ₹1,50,000/month for 20 years
* Young adults realize **owning big assets is unrealistic**
* Result: Shift focus to **small, visible symbols of status**—travel, gadgets, lifestyle

#### 2️⃣ Easy Access to Credit

* Zero-cost EMIs, Buy Now Pay Later, loans under ₹50,000 in **3 clicks**
* Credit is fast, frictionless, and often feels free
* Borrowing is normalized as part of everyday spending

#### 3️⃣ Parental Influence

* Parents often adopt a **compensatory mindset**:
  *“I didn’t have this growing up, so my child should have it.”*
* Result: Children grow up **expecting instant gratification**, viewing lifestyle consumption as normal
* Impulse borrowing gets reinforced early

### **Lessons from Other Cultures**

* In China, Gen Z leaned towards **savings and micro-investments**, influenced by economic uncertainty and job insecurity
* In India, the mindset is often:
  *“Borrow today, I’ll earn tomorrow”*
* This cultural difference matters for **long-term financial stability**

### **Students**

1. **Mindset Over Money**

   * Ask: *“Do I need this, or is it just a status symbol?”*
   * Delay gratification. Plan before spending.

2. **Debt as a Tool, Not a Lifestyle**

   * EMIs and BNPL are conveniences, not free money.
   * Avoid borrowing for experiences you can afford later.

3. **Budget for Reality**

   * Track monthly income and expenses
   * Prioritize essentials first (rent, groceries, bills)

4. **Financial Literacy is Power**

   * Understand interest rates, repayment timelines, and the real cost of credit
   * Small habits today prevent big regrets tomorrow

### **Parents**

1. **Balance Indulgence with Responsibility**

   * Giving children what you didn’t have is okay—but teach **financial boundaries**
   * Don’t normalize “buy now, pay later” for daily living

2. **Model Financial Behavior**

   * Show saving, planning, and budgeting in your own life
   * Children learn habits more from **action than advice**

3. **Start Conversations Early**

   * Talk openly about debt, credit, and money
   * Encourage kids to **question impulsive purchases**

### Key Takeaways**

* **Debt isn’t evil**, but mindless borrowing is dangerous
* **Parental influence matters**—both indulgence and mentorship
* **Financial awareness and planning** are life skills, not optional
* **Social media visibility** can’t replace financial security
* **Mentor + Parent + Student** partnership = strong foundation

### **Call to Action**

> “You don’t need to stop enjoying life—but enjoy responsibly. Budget. Save. Borrow only when necessary. Make debt work for you, not the other way around.”

**Practical Steps Today:**

1. Track every EMI and BNPL purchase this month
2. List all subscriptions and gadgets—ask: “Do I need this now?”
3. Open a savings habit—even ₹500/month compounds over years

Sharing is Caring.
