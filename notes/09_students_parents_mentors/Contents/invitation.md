## 🌱 *Come Join the Transflower Collaborative Classroom*

There was once a batch I taught that I’ll never forget.

The lab was designed for 30 students.
But **50+ showed up every single day**.

Chairs ran out.
Students pulled more in from the next classroom.
Some sat on the floor. Others stood in the narrow corridor, straining to hear.
Most couldn’t even see the whiteboard.
Or reach the keyboard.

**And yet…they came.**

At first, I thought it was because of the subject.
.NET, Data Engineering, Design Patterns, Microservices — the usual suspects.
Maybe they liked how I explained things.

But I later realized —
They didn’t just come for the content.

They came…
Because they loved **learning**.
Because they loved **each other**.
Because that small, overcrowded lab had become something more —

> 🫂 A space of *belonging*.
> 🤝 A place of *connection*.
> 🔥 A community *on fire with curiosity*.

It wasn’t just a class.
It was a **movement**.
And that’s the heart of **Transflower Collaborative Learning**.
