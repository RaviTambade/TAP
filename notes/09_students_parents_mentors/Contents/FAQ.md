# 🌱 Discovering TAP — FAQs with a Personal Touch

## 👩‍🏫 What is TAP?

Let me tell you a story.

Years ago, I watched fresh graduates walk into their first IT job interviews — nervous, uncertain, but full of dreams. The biggest hurdle? **The gap between what they had learned and what the industry expected.**

That’s where **TAP — Transflower Acceleration Program** was born.

> TAP isn’t just another bootcamp. It’s a bridge — between your raw potential and the professional you’re meant to become.

We follow a **project-based learning model** in an **online collaborative environment**. TAP empowers freshers to become **industry-ready FullStack Developers** with guidance from mentors who’ve walked the path for over 25 years.

TAP believes:

> *“Learning is not a destination. It’s a continuous journey.”*


## 💻📚 **Are TAP Bootcamps In-Person or Online?**

Let me share something from the heart…

> *“The real joy of learning — the spark in your eyes, the warmth of discussion, the energy of teamwork — it blossoms in a physical classroom.”*

At **Transflower**, we believe **learning is more than absorbing content** — it’s about **connection, communication, and collaboration**. That’s why we **highly recommend our offline, in-classroom sessions** held at the **Transflower Collaborative Classrooms** in Pune.

### 🌟 In-Classroom Learning — Our First Recommendation

* **Real-time collaboration** with mentors and peers
* **Face-to-face communication** that builds soft skills naturally
* **Classroom energy** that keeps motivation alive
* A **disciplined, immersive** learning environment

But we understand — life isn’t one-size-fits-all.

### 💡 Live Online Classroom — Learn from Anywhere

For those outside Pune or with constraints, we also offer **100% live online classrooms** using Zoom, Teams, or Google Meet — with the **same mentor guidance, live interaction, real-time Q\&A, and project-based activities**.

> Whether you’re in **Pune or Patna**, **Kolkata or Kolhapur**, TAP ensures learning is **accessible, interactive, and impactful**.

### 🔄 Blended Learning — Flexibility with Focus

In fact, many TAP learners benefit from our **blended approach** — attending some sessions **in person**, others **online** based on their availability.

> 💬 *“It’s not about choosing between online or offline. It’s about choosing what helps you stay committed to your learning journey.”*

So yes — TAP offers:

✅ **In-Classroom Physical Bootcamps** (recommended)
✅ **Live Online Bootcamps** (for remote learners)
✅ **Blended Participation** (flexible mode for working professionals)

And no matter where you join from — the **mentor’s voice, the hands-on projects, and the TAP energy stay the same**.


## 🕰 What are the timings for TAP programs?

We know different learners walk different paths. That’s why we offer:

* **Daytime Program**:
