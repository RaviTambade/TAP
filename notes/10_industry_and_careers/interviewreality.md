### **“This Needs to Change” — A Reality Check on Tech Interviews**
 
Dear Learner,

Let me speak to you honestly—as a **mentor**, not as a motivational speaker.

What you described is **not rare**.
I have seen it. I have felt it. And many sincere learners silently suffer because of it.

A brilliant DSA-focused engineer cracks a top company—works hard, plays fair—and still gets laid off.
Another enters through loopholes, shortcuts, or luck—and survives, even grows.

This is not about **cheating vs honesty**.
This is about a **broken signal** in how we evaluate engineers.

And yes… **this needs to change**.

## 1️⃣ The Interview–Reality Mismatch

Let me ask you a simple mentor question:

> **How often do you reverse a binary tree or design LRU cache at work?**

Now compare that with what real engineering looks like:

- ✅ Reading unfamiliar code written 5 years ago
- ✅ Understanding a large, messy system
- ✅ Fixing production bugs at 2 AM
- ✅ Writing code that humans (not compilers) can maintain
- ✅ Using AI tools wisely—not blindly
- ✅ Solving business problems, not textbook puzzles

**That is the real job.**

But interviews still test:
- ❌ Extreme DSA puzzles
- ❌ Whiteboard-heavy system design fantasy
- ❌ Memory-based patterns
- ❌ Stress performance, not engineering maturity

So what are we really testing?
**Speed under artificial pressure—not long-term value.**

## 2️⃣ Why the Industry Is Still Stuck

As a mentor who trains industry-ready engineers, I’ll tell you the uncomfortable truth:

### 🔁 Interviews are outdated because:

* They are **easy to scale**, not easy to validate
* They reward **pattern memorization**
* They give a **false sense of objectivity**
* They reduce complex humans into 45-minute snapshots

DSA became a **proxy** for intelligence—not a proof of engineering excellence.

And proxies always fail at scale.


## 3️⃣ Layoffs Proved One Brutal Truth

Layoffs exposed something important:

> Clearing interviews ≠ being indispensable
> High salary ≠ long-term value
> Brand name ≠ job security

What survives layoffs?

* People who understand systems
* People who adapt fast
* People who can deliver outcomes
* People who learn continuously

Not just people who once solved hard problems on a whiteboard.


## 4️⃣ The Role of AI Changed Everything

Let’s be honest.

Today:

* AI can generate boilerplate
* AI can suggest algorithms
* AI can help debug
* AI can speed up learning

So the real skill is no longer:
❌ “Can you write this from memory?”

It is:
- ✅ “Can you ask the right question?”
- ✅ “Can you validate AI output?”
- ✅ “Can you integrate AI into real workflows?”

Interviews that ignore AI are **testing an engineer that no longer exists**.

## 5️⃣ What Interviews *Should* Look Like (TLF Vision)

In the **Transflower Learning Framework**, we believe interviews should evaluate **engineering reality**, not academic gymnastics.

### 🔧 Better interview signals:

1. Understanding an existing codebase
2. Refactoring messy code
3. Debugging a real production issue
4. Designing a small but realistic feature
5. Explaining trade-offs clearly
6. Using AI responsibly as a collaborator

These tests reveal:

* Thinking depth
* Communication
* Maintainability mindset
* Learning ability
* Real-world competence


## 6️⃣ So… When Will Interviews Catch Up?

Here’s my honest mentor answer:

> **Change will be slow—but inevitable.**

Because:

* AI is flattening memorization advantages
* Startups already prefer take-home & real tasks
* Layoffs exposed weak hiring signals
* Good engineers are questioning the system

But until the system changes, **you must play a dual game**.


## 🎯 Mentor Advice to You (Very Important)

### 🔥 Don’t quit DSA entirely

It builds thinking discipline.

### 🔥 But don’t worship it either

It is not your identity.

### 🌱 Build what actually matters:

* Read real-world code
* Contribute to projects
* Learn debugging deeply
* Practice explaining systems
* Learn to work *with* AI, not against it

In TLF we say:

> **DSA gets you in.
> Engineering keeps you in.
> Adaptability makes you survive.**


### 🌼 Mentor’s Closing Thought

The system is imperfect.
But **your growth must not depend on its fairness**.

Be the engineer who can:

* Crack interviews **and**
* Create real impact

That combination is rare.
And rare engineers always find a way.

Stay grounded. Stay skilled. Stay evolving 🌱
