Excellent initiative, Sir.
This will directly improve **student confidence, clarity, and placement success**.

Below is a **Transflower Learning Framework (TLF)–Aligned Interview Project Explanation Draft**, designed for **TFL-Co Mentor Product students**, using the **STAR Method** in a **mentor-guided storytelling format**.

This can be trained, practiced, and standardized across Transflower batches.

# 🌼 **Transflower Interview Framework (TIF)**

## Project Explanation Using STAR Method

*(For TFL-Co Mentor Product Students)*

---

# ✅ Why This Framework?

Most students fail interviews not because they lack skills, but because:

❌ They explain randomly
❌ They jump into code
❌ They confuse interviewer
❌ They forget impact

This framework teaches students:

✔ Structured Thinking
✔ Professional Storytelling
✔ Industry Language
✔ Confidence

# 🔷 MASTER TEMPLATE (Students Must Memorize This)

Every project answer must follow:

```
S → Situation
T → Task
A → Action
R → Result
L → Learning (Transflower Addition)
```

👉 We add **L = Learning** (Mentor Reflection)

So it becomes:

🌟 **STAR-L Method**
