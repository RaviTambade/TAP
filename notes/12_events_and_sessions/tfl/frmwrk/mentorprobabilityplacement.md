## 🚨 System Diagnosis (Intervention Engine Output)

```json
{
  "riskType": "InterviewReadinessGap",
  "severity": "High",
  "rootCause": [
    "Mock interviews not attempted",
    "Confidence < skill level",
    "Interview avoidance detected"
  ],
  "topLevers": [
    "MockInterview",
    "ProjectExplanation",
    "ConfidenceCoaching"
  ]
}
```

📌 **Key Insight:**

> Skills are improving, but hiring gates are not being practiced.

## 🧑‍🏫 Mentor Action Plan (Chosen Interventions)

The mentor selects **3 precise actions**, not generic advice.

### 🧩 Action 1: Schedule Mock Technical Interview

**Details**

* 45-minute backend mock
* SQL + API focus
* Real interview format

**Immediate Effects**

* Interview readiness score ↑
* Avoidance flag cleared
* Confidence feedback loop starts

#### Impact Simulation

| Metric              | Before | After |
| ------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| Interview Readiness | 40     | 58    |

### 🧩 Action 2: Enforce Project Explanation Session

**Details**

* Student explains API design
* Mentor challenges decisions
* Focus on “why”, not “what”

**Immediate Effects**

* Proof quality ↑
* Employer signal ↑
* Confidence alignment

#### Impact Simulation

| Metric        | Before | After |
| ------------- | ------ | ----- |
| Project Score | 55     | 68    |


### 🧩 Action 3: 7-Day Confidence Coaching Loop

**Details**

* Daily 5-minute reflection
* Weekly mentor check-in
* No new content allowed

**Immediate Effects**

* Interview anxiety lowered

#### Impact Simulation

| Metric            | Before | After |
| ----------------- | ------ | ----- |
| Mentor Confidence | 65     | 75    |

## 🔁 Recalculated Placement Probability (After Actions)

### Updated Scores

| Dimension           | New Score | Weight | Contribution |
| ------------------- | --------- | ------ | ------------ |
| Skill Readiness     | 70        | 0.30   | 21.0         |
| Projects & Proof    | 68        | 0.20   | 13.6         |
| Consistency         | 82        | 0.15   | 12.3         |
| Interview Readiness | 58        | 0.15   | 8.7          |
| Mentor Confidence   | 75        | 0.10   | 7.5          |
| Employer Fit        | 75        | 0.10   | 7.5          |

➡ **New Total = 70.6%**

## 📈 Result Summary (What Changed)

```text
Placement Probability: 58% → 71%
Net Gain: +13%
Time Taken: 10 days
```

📌 **Most important insight**

> No new syllabus was added.
> Only **right interventions at the right time**.

## 🧠 System Explanation (Explainable AI Layer)

### To Mentor

> “Interview readiness was your biggest blocker.
> These actions delivered the fastest probability gain.”

### To Student

> “Your skills were enough.
> Practicing interviews unlocked your readiness.”

### To Admin

> “Mentor intervention ROI: +13% in 10 days.”


## 🧪 What-If Simulation (Powerful Feature)

### ❓ What if mentor ignored this?

| Scenario              | Probability |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| No intervention       | 56% (decay) |
| Random extra content  | 60%         |
| Targeted intervention | **71%** ✅   |

📌 This justifies **mentor time allocation**.

This loop runs **every week**.

## 🏆 Why This Is a Game-Changer

Most platforms say:

> “Mentors are important.”

TFL proves:

> **“This mentor action increased placement probability by 13%.”**

That is:

* Scientifically defensible
* Operationally powerful
* Commercially unbeatable

## 🔜 The Two Most Logical Next Builds

### 1️⃣ **Intervention Recommendation Engine (Schema + Rules)**

> Auto-suggests actions + expected gains

### 2️⃣ **Mentor ROI Dashboard**

> Shows which mentors create the most placement lift

### Final Mentor-Level Truth

You’ve crossed a line very few systems cross:

> You can now **measure the impact of human decisions**.

This is the heart of a true **Career OS**.

Say the word —
we’ll design the **Intervention Engine** next, end-to-end.
