# Transflower Learning Framework (TFL) 
## 🌱 *“From Question Papers to Learning Intelligence”*

Earlier, assessments were simple:

* One faculty
* One syllabus
* One question paper

But **TFLAssessment** is different.

You are not testing *memory*.
You are **measuring growth, thinking, and skill readiness**.

So we don’t need a *question paper generator*.
We need an **AI Assessment Engine**.



## 🎯 Vision of TFLAssessment AI Engine

> **“Assess what matters, generate what is needed, adapt to who is learning.”**

This engine should:

* Generate **questions**
* Build **tests**
* Design **assessments**
* Adapt to **learner level, role & skill gap**
* Help **mentors**, not replace them


## 🧠 Core Capabilities of the AI Engine

### 1️⃣ Intelligent Question Bank Generator

AI generates questions based on:

| Dimension     | Examples                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Subject       | C#, Java, Python, SQL, Web, Cloud                |
| Skill Level   | Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced               |
| Bloom’s Level | Remember → Understand → Apply → Analyze → Create |
| Question Type | MCQ, Coding, Scenario, Debugging, Design         |
| Context       | Industry-oriented, project-based                 |

📌 **Output Example**

* “Explain”
* “Predict output”
* “Fix the bug”
* “Design a solution”
* “Optimize this code”


### 2️⃣ Skill-Mapped Question Model (Very Important)

Every question must be tagged with:

```
Skill → Sub-skill → Concept → Difficulty → Outcome
```

Example:

```
Skill: ASP.NET Core
Sub-skill: Dependency Injection
Concept: Service Lifetimes
Difficulty: Medium
Outcome: Can choose correct lifetime in real apps
```

👉 This is what converts **questions into learning intelligence**.



### 3️⃣ Test Generator (Mentor-Controlled)

AI builds tests based on mentor inputs:

**Mentor selects:**

* Role (Junior Developer / Full Stack / Backend)
* Skills (C#, OOP, SQL)
* Difficulty mix (30% easy, 50% medium, 20% hard)
* Duration
* Question types

**AI produces:**

* Balanced test
* No repeated concepts
* Progressive difficulty
* Real-world scenarios


### 4️⃣ Assessment Types Supported

| Type           | Purpose                 |
| -------------- | ----------------------- |
| Diagnostic     | Entry-level skill check |
| Formative      | Learning-time feedback  |
| Summative      | Final evaluation        |
| Skill Gap      | What student lacks      |
| Role Readiness | Job-oriented            |

## 🧩 AI Engine Components (Technical View)

### 🔹 1. Knowledge Base

* Curriculum
* Skill taxonomy
* Mentor-approved question templates
* Past assessments

### 🔹 2. Prompt Engineering Layer

* Structured prompts (not free text)
* Role-based generation
* Difficulty constraints

### 🔹 3. Validation Layer (Critical)

* No wrong answers
* No hallucinations
* Code execution checks (for coding Qs)
* Mentor approval loop

### 🔹 4. Analytics Engine

* Skill coverage %
* Bloom level coverage
* Student performance trends
* Weak concept detection


## 📊 Example: AI-Generated Assessment Flow

1. Student selects: **“Full Stack .NET – Level 1”**
2. AI generates:

   * 10 MCQs (concept clarity)
   * 5 coding questions
   * 2 scenario questions
3. Student submits
4. AI evaluates:

   * Accuracy
   * Time taken
   * Concept gaps
5. Mentor dashboard shows:

   * “Good in C#, weak in LINQ & DI”
   * “Needs project-based reinforcement”


## 🧠 Why This Fits Transflower Mentors Perfectly

✔ Skill-first
✔ Mentor-guided
✔ Project-oriented
✔ Industry aligned
✔ Not exam-centric

This is **assessment as mentorship**, not judgment.

## 🚀 Suggested Roadmap (Practical & Realistic)

### Phase 1 – Foundation (No AI Overkill)

* Skill taxonomy
* Question templates
* Manual + semi-AI generation

### Phase 2 – AI Assisted

* LLM-generated questions
* Rule-based validation
* Mentor review

### Phase 3 – Adaptive Intelligence

* Auto difficulty adjustment
* Skill gap prediction
* Personalized assessments
