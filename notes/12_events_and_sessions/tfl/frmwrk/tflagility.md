### **Agile Methodology in Its True Form**

We are following **Agile methodology**—not just in theory, but in practice.

Agile means:

* Incremental development
* Iterative refinement
* Starting without full clarity
* Learning while building

In real companies:

* The first version is built with limited understanding
* A demo is shown to the customer
* During development, **business requirements change**
* Customer priorities shift
* Market realities evolve

As a result:

* User stories are rewritten
* Test cases are updated
* Code is refactored
* Architecture is improved

This is not failure.
This is **software engineering maturity**.

### **A Real Company Environment for Students**

Those of you who have completed your engineering degrees are now experiencing something rare:

A **true company-like environment**, starting from:

* Idea conception
* System design
* Architecture evolution
* Continuous refactoring

You are not just writing code.
You are learning **how systems grow**.
