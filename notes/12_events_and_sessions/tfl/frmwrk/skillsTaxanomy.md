# ** Skills Taxonomy document** for the TFL

This taxonomy is intentionally:

* **Language-agnostic** (Java, C#, Python, JS, C++)
* **Role-adaptive** (Backend, Full Stack, DevOps, AI)
* **Assessment-ready** (AI + human mentor)
* **Graph-based**, not checklist-based
* **Industry-aligned**, not syllabus-driven

### How you can use this immediately

* 📘 As the **official TFL Skills Reference**
* 🧠 As the backbone for your **AI assessment engine**
* 🧩 To derive **curriculum layers, projects, and skill gyms**
* 📊 For **student → skill → job-readiness graphs**
* 🧭 For **dropout recovery & regression detection**

### Natural next steps (recommended)

We can now build on this in a very powerful way:

1. **Skill → Assessment blueprint** (question types per skill)
2. **Skill Gym UX** (daily practice loops)
3. **Student Skill Graph JSON model**
4. **Role-wise skill weight matrix**
5. **Mentor dashboard view**
6. **Auto-curriculum generation logic**
7. **Skill decay & regression model**

Tell me which one you want to design next — and we’ll go deep, architect-level, not superficial.
