### **Employer Matching & Monitoring System (EMS)**

Beyond readiness, the system also supports:

* Employer matching
* Employer Monitoring Systems (EMS)

Employers can:

* View candidate scorecards
* Drill down into skills, projects, and assessments
* Monitor progress even before interviews

This creates transparency and trust **before hiring decisions are made**.

### **System Architecture: Learning by Building**

Technically, what you are building today is just as important as what the system represents.

Currently:

* The application is monolithic
* Databases are evolving
* Tables are being refined
* Dashboards are under active development

As the **TFL framework evolves**, system characteristics evolve with it.

That is why:
* Database schemas change
* Tables are merged or split
* Queries are refined
* Stored procedures are realigned

This is **real-world system design in action**.

### **Normalization, Denormalization & Business Alignment**

As many of you already understand:
* Normalization improves structure and integrity
* Denormalization improves performance and access

We apply these principles based on **business requirements**, not theory.

Every schema decision is validated through:
* Join queries
* Business logic alignment
* Performance considerations

This continuous refinement is exactly how **enterprise systems are built**.
