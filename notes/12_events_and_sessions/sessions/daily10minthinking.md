# Daily 10-Minute Thinking Workout
This is the **smallest daily habit with the biggest cognitive ROI**.

**Transflower Learning Framework (TFL)**
*Do this once every day — preferably before work or interviews*

## ⏱ Structure (10 Minutes Total)

| Minute | Focus         |
| ------ | ------------- |
| 0–1    | Grounding     |
| 1–3    | Analytical    |
| 3–5    | Critical      |
| 5–7    | Systems       |
| 7–9    | Reflective    |
| 9–10   | Verbalization |

## 🧘 0–1 min: Grounding (Calm the System)

* Sit upright
* Inhale 4 sec → hold 2 → exhale 6
* Repeat twice

**Mentor cue:**

> *A calm mind thinks faster than a rushed one.*


## 🔍 1–3 min: Analytical Thinking

Ask:

> “What is ONE thing I’m working on today?”

Break it into **3 parts**:

1. ---
2. ---
3. ---

**Example (API):**

* Controller responsibility
* Service logic
* Data access


## 🧪 3–5 min: Critical Thinking

Challenge your assumption:

> “Why am I doing it this way?”

* What could go wrong?
* What is the risk?
* What is the simplest alternative?

Write **one risk**:

> ---


## 🔄 5–7 min: Systems Thinking

Zoom out:

> “How does this connect to the whole system?”

Fill this:

> If this part fails, ____________ will be impacted.

**Example:**

> If JWT validation fails, all protected APIs fail.

**TFL Insight:**

> *Good engineers see chains, not nodes.*


## 🪞 7–9 min: Reflective Thinking

Ask honestly:

> “What emotion is present right now?”

☐ Calm
☐ Anxious
☐ Confident
☐ Avoiding
☐ Curious

Then:

> “Is this emotion helping or blocking thinking?”


## 🗣️ 9–10 min: Verbalization Drill (Most Important)

Speak aloud (not in head):

> “Today I am working on __________.
> It exists to __________.
> If it fails, __________ happens.”

**Why this matters:**
Interview clarity is trained **outside interviews**.


## 🔁 Optional Weekly Rotation (Advanced)

| Day | Emphasis      |
| --- | ------------- |
| Mon | Analytical    |
| Tue | Critical      |
| Wed | Systems       |
| Thu | Communication |
| Fri | Strategic     |
| Sat | Reflection    |
| Sun | Reset         |


## 🧭 Mentor Rule (Read Daily)

> Skills make you employable.
> Thinking makes you **irreplaceable**.
