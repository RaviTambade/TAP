# 🔁 Weekly Self-Coaching Loop

This is where **short-term performance turns into long-term mastery**.

Below is the **Weekly Self-Coaching Loop**, designed using the **Transflower Learning Framework (TFL)**.
It is intentionally **simple, repeatable, and honest** — because consistency beats intensity.

**Transflower Learning Framework (TFL)**
*30–45 minutes | Once every week*

## 🧘 1. Settle the Mind (5 minutes)

*(Before analysis comes awareness)*

* Sit comfortably
* Close distractions
* Take **5 slow breaths**

Ask yourself:

> “What kind of week did I just have — mentally, not technically?”

Write one word:

> ---

**TFL Principle:**

> *Clarity begins when the nervous system is calm.*


## 🔍 2. Observe Without Judgment (10 minutes)

Answer **factually**, not emotionally.

### Work / Learning Highlights

* One thing that went **well**:

  > ---

* One thing that felt **difficult**:

  > ---

* One moment I felt **pressure**:

  > ---


## 🧠 3. Thinking Quality Review (10 minutes)

### Which thinking modes did I use this week?

☐ Analytical
☐ Critical
☐ Creative
☐ Strategic
☐ Reflective
☐ Practical
☐ Systems

**Where did my thinking break down?**

> ---

**TFL Insight:**

Choose **ONE** behavior for next week:

☐ Slow down my answers
☐ Ask one clarifying question per meeting
☐ Protect 90 minutes of deep work daily

**My commitment (write it):**

> “Next week, I will _______________________.”

**TFL Rule:**
