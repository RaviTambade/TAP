A Full-Stack .NET Developer is a Software Developer who is proficient in both front-end and back-end development, using the .NET ecosystem (primarily .NET Core, ASP.NET Core, and other related frameworks). This role involves building and maintaining complete web applications, from the user interface (UI) to the underlying databases, APIs, and server-side code.

Below is a roadmap outlining the skills and technologies you'll need to become a proficient .NET full-stack developer:

### **TAP Full stack Software Developer Roadmap:**

TAP (Transflower Acceleration Program) prepares developers to build scalable, efficient, and modern software solutions using the **.NET **, integrate  **AI**, deploy applications using **AWS** and **Docker**, and implement **Scrum** and **CI/CD** practices to ensure smooth development cycles and robust software releases.

This program ensures that students not only learn to develop full-stack applications but also gain a solid understanding of database programming and management, both with SQL Server and MySQL.
