## 🌱 Transflower Closing Reflection

Java Fullstack is not about:

* Writing more code
* Memorizing frameworks
* Passing interviews

It is about:

* **Engineering discipline**
* **Long-term system thinking**
* **Responsibility at scale**

At Transflower, Java is not taught as a language.
It is taught as a **professional mindset**.
