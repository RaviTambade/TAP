# Indian Students vs. Abroad Students

The difference between Indian students learning software development and their counterparts aborad is indeed significant. Love to share my observation and learning experience during mentoring:

**Aborad:**
- Emphasis on project-based learning: 
<p>Students focus on creating real-world projects, often through participation in hackathons. They collaborate with peers, work on projects collaboratively, and learn by solving practical problems.</p>
- Hands-on experience: 
Students graduate with several completed projects, showcasing their skills in software development. They demonstrate their contributions and the impact of their projects on the market or specific industries.
- Grading based on project ideas: 
Evaluation criteria may include grading based on the originality and execution of project ideas. Students are encouraged to build applications, games, or websites from scratch using specific tech stacks.
- Integration of DevOps and CI/CD: 
Students are expected to have knowledge of DevOps, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines in addition to front-end or back-end development skills.

**India:**
- Emphasis on theoretical learning: Students often rely on taking notes and learning from textbooks or online courses. The focus is more on understanding coding concepts rather than practical application.
- Lack of project-based learning culture: 
The educational system may not prioritize project-based learning or provide opportunities for collaborative project work.
- Limited grading based on project ideas: 
Few colleges grade students based on their project ideas or originality. The emphasis may be more on theoretical understanding rather than practical execution.
- Traditional focus on DSA: 
While data structures and algorithms (DSA) are essential for interviews, there is debate about their relevance in real-world software development.

**Overall:**
- Importance of networking and open source contributions: Regardless of location, networking and open source contributions are valuable for showcasing skills and gaining visibility in the tech industry.
- Adaptation to industry trends: Students need to adapt to industry trends and technologies, such as DevOps, cloud computing, and full-stack development, to remain competitive in the job market.
- Persistence and patience: Facing rejections and challenges is part of the journey, and students should focus on enjoying coding, being creative, and continuously learning and improving their skills.

Event though, there may be differences in educational approaches between Indian and abroad software learning students, both groups can benefit from focusing on practical, project-based learning, staying updated with industry trends, and actively participating in networking and open source communities.

We at Transflower working on problem to solve last from three years. And it's helping to build 4'cs in students.


- Creativity
- Collaboration
- Communication
- Critical Thinking
