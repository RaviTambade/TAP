## 🌱 Transflower Closing Reflection

.NET Core Fullstack is not about:

* Memorizing framework features
* Writing verbose code
* Passing certification exams

It is about:

* **Clean architecture**
* **Maintainability**
* **Enterprise responsibility**

At Transflower, .NET is not taught as a framework.
It is taught as a **professional engineering ecosystem**.
