## 🚨 The Biggest Lie in AI?

> *It’s not the tech. It’s the pitch.*

We were told AI would **think for us**, **replace us**, and **redefine reality**.
But what most people got?

📊 A dashboard.
🎙️ A glorified assistant.
📎 A smarter version of Clippy.

### 💥 **Here’s the truth:**

AI projects **rarely fail** because of **bad models**.
They fail because of **bad expectations.**

> 🚫 "Let’s build a fully autonomous system from scratch!"
> ✅ Reality: “Can we solve one real problem *well* first?”

### 🛠️ So if you don’t want to waste **6 months** and **₹1 lakh**, follow this roadmap:

1. **Start small.**
   Solve one real-world use case. Just one.

2. **Build a working car.**
   Not a concept spaceship. Not a theoretical unicorn.

3. **Make it *useful* to users.**
   Not just impressive to investors.

4. **Get adoption.**
   No users = no impact. No impact = no value.

5. **Then scale.**
   Add horsepower once the wheels are spinning.

6. **Expand the use cases.**
   Layer intelligence like seasoning — not like cement.

### 🚗💡 Because a working car today

**> a grounded rocket tomorrow.**

🔑 *Remember:*
Tech is not magic.
Progress is *pragmatic.*
