# 🚨 The Biggest Lie in AI?

> *“Beta, AI is going to change the world!” they said…*
> But no one told us **how** — or worse, they told us **everything**.

Let me take you back a few years.

As a startup founder called me after raising his first round of funding.

> “We’re going to build an AI that automates legal contracts, predicts outcomes, negotiates deals, and even generates voice responses. Think ChatGPT meets Harvey Specter!”

I smiled and said,

> “Why don’t we first build something that reminds lawyers to reply to emails on time?”

That is the way, Translower is growing organically not artificially.


### 💥 **Here’s the real truth I’ve seen over and over:**

AI doesn’t fail because the model is bad.
It fails because the **expectations are wild.**

> ❌ “We want an autonomous system that handles everything.”
> ✅ Reality: *“Can we solve **one real problem** reliably first?”*


## 🔍 Let’s Talk Strategy — Not Dreams

You don’t need an AI spaceship. You need a **working car**.
Something with wheels. Something that moves people.
Something that solves one problem well.

So here’s the roadmap I give every mentee — whether they’re a fresher with ambition or a founder with funding.


### 🛠️ Step-by-Step Mentor Wisdom

#### 1. **🎯 Start Small**

Don't chase “general intelligence.”
Instead, automate a daily annoyance — maybe invoice classification or ticket routing.

> *“Solve a ₹1 problem today, and tomorrow it becomes ₹1 crore in value.”*



#### 2. **🚗 Build a Working Car**

Not a rocket that can't lift off.
Not a Ferrari without wheels.
Just build something that runs on real data and gives real output.

> "A dumb but working AI is better than a smart one that never ships."

#### 3. **👥 Make It Useful**

A fancy dashboard that no one uses?
That’s not AI. That’s **PowerPoint with GPU support**.

> *"Ask the user, not the investor: Does this help you today?"*


#### 4. **📈 Drive Adoption**

No users? No feedback.
No feedback? No learning.
No learning? Your AI is just a pet project.

> "If no one's clicking it, you’re not solving a problem — you're showcasing a prototype."


#### 5. **⚙️ THEN Scale**

Only **after** your first use case survives the real world —
Add more data, train a deeper model, automate further.

> *“Don’t buy a bus until people are riding the bike.”*



#### 6. **🌶️ Layer Intelligence Slowly**

Season the system with AI — like salt in cooking, not cement in construction.

Start with rules.
Then add heuristics.
Then sprinkle models.
Then learn.
Then refine.


### 🚗💡 Because a **working Maruti** today…

> …is worth more than a **grounded Tesla** tomorrow.


## 🔑 Final Mentor Words

AI is powerful, no doubt.
But **power without purpose** is just wasted potential.

✨ *Don’t chase “artificial general intelligence.” Chase “actual genuine impact.”*

> *“Progress, not promises.” That’s how real transformation begins.*

Until next sprint,
